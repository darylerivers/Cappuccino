   - Disk: 46% used (plenty of space)

4. **Model Quality**
   - Found models 2x better than old best
   - Top 20 all significantly outperform old ensemble
   - Clear convergence on successful hyperparameters

### Bottlenecks (None Critical)

1. **Training Speed** ⚠️ Minor
   - Limited by: GPU processing time for neural network training
   - Current: ~20 min/trial with 3 workers
   - Could improve with: More workers (would saturate GPU)
   - **Assessment:** Not worth changing, current rate is excellent

2. **Data Download** ⚠️ Minor
   - Fresh data needed manually every ~30 days
   - 10 minutes to download
   - **Recommendation:** Automate monthly data refresh

3. **Paper Trading Measurement** ⚠️ Minor
   - Can't evaluate new models until deployed
   - Need 24-48 hours per ensemble change
   - **Assessment:** Acceptable, safety feature

### Potential Improvements

1. **Automated Data Refresh** (Priority: Medium)
   - Schedule: Monthly or when data >30 days old
   - Script: `prepare_1year_training_data.py --months 24`
   - Benefit: Never fall behind on market data

2. **Progressive Ensemble Transition** (Priority: Low)
   - Instead of replacing all 20 models at once
   - Gradually introduce new models (A/B testing)
   - Benefit: Smoother performance transitions

3. **Performance Attribution** (Priority: Low)
   - Track which models in ensemble are performing best live
   - Retire underperformers faster
   - Benefit: Better ensemble composition
