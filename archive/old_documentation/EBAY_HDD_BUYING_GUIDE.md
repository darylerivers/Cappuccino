# eBay Used/Refurbished HDD Buying Guide

**Date:** January 17, 2026
**Use Case:** Backup storage for trading models (not critical data - you have primary copies)
**Risk Tolerance:** Medium (data is backed up on primary NVMe, this is secondary backup)

---

## TL;DR - eBay Buying Strategy

### Target Specs
- **Capacity:** 4 TB (3 TB acceptable, 6 TB if cheap)
- **Type:** Enterprise/NAS drives (not consumer desktop)
- **Technology:** CMR (avoid SMR!)
- **Price Range:** $40-60 for 4TB
- **Power-On Hours:** < 20,000 hours preferred (< 40,000 acceptable)
- **Seller Rating:** 98%+ with 500+ reviews

### Best Used Models to Target
1. **HGST/Hitachi Ultrastar** (most reliable)
2. **Seagate Exos** (enterprise grade)
3. **WD Gold/Red Pro** (not regular Red)
4. **Toshiba Enterprise (MG series)**

### Price Expectations (Jan 2026)
- 2 TB enterprise: $25-35
- 3 TB enterprise: $35-45
- 4 TB enterprise: $45-60
- 6 TB enterprise: $60-80

---

## Why Used Can Work for Your Use Case

### ✅ Good Fit Because:
1. **Secondary backup** - Primary data on NVMe SSD
2. **Not mission-critical** - Can rebuild from primary if drive fails
3. **Sequential writes** - Backup workload, not random I/O
4. **Budget conscious** - $50 used vs $80 new (37% savings)
5. **Enterprise drives** - Better built than consumer drives

### ⚠️ Understand the Risks:
1. **No warranty** - Drive fails, you're out the money
2. **Unknown history** - Could have been abused
3. **Shorter lifespan** - May fail sooner than new
4. **No guarantees** - Even "tested" drives can fail
5. **Scam potential** - eBay has fake listings

**For backups (not primary storage), this is acceptable risk.**

## Reading SMART Data

### Key SMART Attributes to Check

**Most Important:**
1. **Power_On_Hours (09):**
   - < 10,000 hours: Excellent
   - 10,000-20,000: Good
   - 20,000-40,000: Acceptable
   - > 40,000: Risky (but cheap)
   - > 60,000: Avoid

2. **Reallocated_Sector_Ct (05):**
   - 0: Perfect ✅
   - 1-10: Concerning ⚠️
   - > 10: Avoid ❌

3. **Current_Pending_Sector (197):**
   - 0: Good ✅
   - > 0: Drive is failing ❌

4. **Offline_Uncorrectable (198):**
   - 0: Good ✅
   - > 0: Drive has errors ❌

**Calculation:**
- Power-on hours ÷ 24 ÷ 365 = years of use
- 20,000 hours = 2.3 years
- 40,000 hours = 4.6 years

**Example good SMART:**
```
  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0
  9 Power_On_Hours          18500  (2.1 years)
197 Current_Pending_Sector  0
198 Offline_Uncorrectable   0
```

**Example bad SMART:**
```
  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   45     ← BAD!
  9 Power_On_Hours          65000  ← OLD!
197 Current_Pending_Sector  12     ← FAILING!
198 Offline_Uncorrectable   8      ← ERRORS!
```

## Negotiating and Buying Strategy

### Best Time to Buy
- **After holidays** (Jan-Feb) - Server decommissions
- **End of quarter** (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec) - Data center cleanouts
- **Avoid summer** - Prices often higher

### Search Terms to Use
```
"HGST 4TB enterprise"
"Seagate Exos 4TB"
"WD Gold 4TB"
"enterprise hard drive 4TB"
"data center HDD"
"server pull hard drive"
```

### Filter Settings
- **Condition:** Used
- **Buy It Now** (not auction for consistent pricing)
- **Price:** $40-70 for 4TB
- **Shipping:** USA (avoid international)
- **Returns:** Accepted

### Making an Offer
Many sellers accept offers:
- **List price $60 → Offer $50**
- "Would you take $50 shipped?"
- Best with sellers who have multiple listings
- Don't lowball (< 20% off), they'll decline

### Bulk Buying
If buying 2-3 drives:
- Ask for combined shipping discount
- Ask for bulk discount (10-15% off)
- Lower risk per drive

---

## Testing After Purchase

### Day 1: Initial Test
```bash
# Check SMART data
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb

# Look for:
# - Power-on hours matches listing
# - 0 reallocated sectors
# - 0 pending sectors
# - No errors
```

### Day 1-3: Short Test
```bash
# Run SMART short test (5 minutes)
sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sdb

# Wait 5 min, check results
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb
```

### Day 3-7: Full Surface Test
```bash
# Run extended test (8-12 hours)
sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdb

# Or use badblocks (more thorough)
sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdb
# WARNING: This erases all data!
```

### If Any Issues:
- **Within 30 days:** Return via eBay
- **Contact seller first:** Give them chance to resolve
- **Open eBay case if needed:** eBay usually sides with buyers
- **PayPal protection:** 180 days

---

## Return Policy Strategy

### Always Choose Listings With:
- ✅ "30-day money back"
- ✅ "Returns accepted"
- ✅ Free return shipping (rare but exists)

### Avoid:
- ❌ "No returns"
- ❌ "As-is"
- ❌ "Buyer pays return shipping" (unless very confident)

### Testing Window:
- Test immediately upon arrival
- Open eBay return within 3 days if issues
- Don't wait until day 29

---

## Cost Breakdown: Used vs New

### 4TB Drive Example

**New (Seagate IronWolf):**
- Drive: $80
- Warranty: 3 years
- Expected life: 5-7 years
- Cost per year: $11-16

**Used (HGST Ultrastar, 20k hours):**
- Drive: $55
- Warranty: None (30-day return only)
- Expected life: 2-4 years
- Cost per year: $14-27

**Analysis:**
- Used saves $25 upfront (31% savings)
- New has warranty and longer expected life
- Used is good value if you're comfortable with risk

**For backups (not primary), used makes sense!**

---

## Recommended eBay Buying Plan

### Conservative Approach ($55-65)
**Target:** HGST Ultrastar 4TB, < 20k hours
- Best reliability
- Worth paying a bit more
- Search: "HGST HUS724040ALE640"

### Value Approach ($45-55)
**Target:** Seagate Exos 4TB, < 30k hours
- Good balance of price and reliability
- Search: "Seagate Exos 4TB ST4000NM0035"

### Budget Approach ($35-45)
**Target:** Toshiba MG or HGST 3TB
- Smaller capacity but very cheap
- 3TB still handles 5,000 trials + backups
- Search: "HGST 3TB enterprise" or "Toshiba MG03"

### Aggressive Value ($40-50)
**Target:** Higher hours (30-40k) enterprise drives
- HGST/Seagate with more wear
- Could fail sooner but still good for backups
- Search: "HGST 4TB" filter by price

## Final Thoughts

### Used Drives Can Work Well For:
- ✅ Backup storage (not primary)
- ✅ Budget-conscious buyers
- ✅ Enterprise-grade models
- ✅ Secondary/tertiary copies
- ✅ Non-critical data

### Used Drives Are Risky For:
- ❌ Primary storage
- ❌ Critical data with no backups
- ❌ High-availability needs
- ❌ When downtime is costly
- ❌ Mission-critical systems

**For your use case (backup storage for model checkpoints), used enterprise drives are a good fit.**

---

## Quick Reference Card

**Best Models:**
1. HGST Ultrastar ($50-60)
2. Seagate Exos ($45-55)
3. WD Gold/Red Pro ($55-65)

**Max Power-On Hours:** 30,000 (prefer < 20,000)
**Must Have:** 0 reallocated sectors

**Returns:** Must accept returns

**Red Flags:**
- Consumer drives (Barracuda, Blue, Red non-Pro)
