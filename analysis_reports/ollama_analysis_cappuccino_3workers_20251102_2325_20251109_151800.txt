### KEY INSIGHTS:
1. **Top Performers vs Bottom Performers**:
   - The top performers have higher `norm_action` values (23100 vs 22100), indicating they might be taking more aggressive actions, which could lead to better returns.
   - Top performers also tend to have a smaller `net_dimension` (1280 vs 1440), suggesting a potentially more efficient network structure.
   - The top performers have slightly lower `eval_time_gap` (60 vs 72), meaning they might be evaluating their strategies more frequently, which could lead to better adaptation.

2. **Impactful Parameters**:
   - `norm_action`: Higher values seem to correlate with better performance.
   - `net_dimension`: Smaller network sizes tend to perform better.
   - `eval_time_gap`: Lower evaluation gaps indicate frequent updates and potentially better policy refinement.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES:
1. **NaN Values**:
   - There are NaN (Not a Number) values in the best value, which could indicate issues with the agent's decision-making process or data handling. This requires further investigation into why these values occurred.

2. **High Standard Deviation**:
   - The standard deviation of 0.026635 suggests that there is considerable variability in performance across trials, indicating that some parameters might not be finely tuned enough.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Increase `norm_action` Range**:
   - Try increasing the range for `norm_action` to values above 23100 to see if even more aggressive actions could lead to higher returns.
   
2. **Reduce `net_dimension` Variability**:
   - Explore smaller values of `net_dimension`, such as in the range of [512, 768], to potentially reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

3. **Adjust `eval_time_gap`**:
   - Vary `eval_time_gap` between 40 and 80 to balance exploration and exploitation.

4. **Fine-Tune `base_target_step`**:
   - Try values around the mean of 877 (±20) to see if more stable target steps could lead to better performance.

5. **Explore Different Reward Normalization**:
   - Vary `norm_reward_exp` between -14 and -12 to explore different levels of reward scaling that might stabilize training.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:
1. **Narrow Down `norm_action`**:
   - Narrow the range for `norm_action` from 20000 to 25000 to focus on higher values more closely.
   
2. **Expand `net_dimension` Range**:
   - Expand the range for `net_dimension` from [1280, 1440] to [512, 1920] to explore a broader spectrum of network sizes.

3. **Adjust `eval_time_gap` and `base_target_step`**:
   - Explore smaller increments for both parameters, such as ±5 units around the mean values.

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:
1. **Try PPO Variants**:
   - Consider using PPO variants like PPO2 or PPO3, which might have different stability characteristics and could perform better in this environment.

2. **Explore TD3 or SAC for Exploration**:
   - If the agent is under-exploring, consider experimenting with algorithms that inherently handle exploration more effectively, such as TD3 or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).

3. **Adjust Learning Rate Schedules**:
   - Experiment with different learning rate schedules for the actor and critic networks to find the best learning dynamics.

### Conclusion:
The key insights suggest that higher action normalization, smaller network dimensions, and frequent evaluations are beneficial. Addressing NaN values and refining hyperparameter ranges could significantly improve performance. Additionally, exploring alternative algorithms might provide further gains in stability and efficiency.
