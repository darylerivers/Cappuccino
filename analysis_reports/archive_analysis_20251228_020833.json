  "ai_insights": "1. KEY FINDINGS:\n   - The most significant correlation is between \"gamma\" and \"norm_action,\" indicating that as gamma increases, norm_action also tends to increase.\n   - Negative correlations are seen between \"gamma\" and \"min_cash_reserve,\" \"volatility_penalty,\" and \"lookback,\" suggesting that higher values of gamma might require more cash reserves and lower volatility penalties.\n   - The parameter \"gamma\" has a mean value of 0.9807, indicating that it is generally set to high values across the trials.\n\n2. OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n   - Trial number 191 stands out as one of the highest-performing configurations with a value of 0.156558. This trial should be reconsidered and possibly further optimized or replicated in future experiments.\n   - Trial numbers 192, 26, 83, and others also show high performance, indicating that there might be valuable insights within these trials that could be exploited.\n\n3. PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n   - Future training should focus on setting \"gamma\" values between 0.95 and 1.0 to leverage the positive correlation with \"norm_action.\"\n   - The \"min_cash_reserve\" parameter should be set between 0.04 and 0.25, as this range shows a balance between minimizing risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n   - \"Norm_tech_exp\" should be adjusted within the range of -18.0 to -15.0 to improve performance based on its negative correlation with both \"gamma\" and \"norm_action.\"\n\n4. INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n   - The interaction between \"gamma,\" \"min_cash_reserve,\" and \"norm_tech_exp\" is promising, as it shows a complex relationship that could be further investigated.\n   - Exploring the impact of varying \"gamma\" with different values of \"volatility_penalty\" might reveal more optimal configurations.\n\n5. ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n   - **Increase Exploration**: Introduce more exploration in the training process by adjusting parameters like \"lr_schedule_factor\" and \"eval_time_gap\" to better understand their impact on performance.\n   - **Fine-Tune Hyperparameters**: Focus on fine-tuning hyperparameters such as \"gamma,\" \"min_cash_reserve,\" and \"norm_action\" within their sweet spot ranges identified in the data.\n   - **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Continuously monitor performance metrics like \"mean_value,\" \"std_value,\" and \"best_value\" to ensure that improvements are being made over time."
