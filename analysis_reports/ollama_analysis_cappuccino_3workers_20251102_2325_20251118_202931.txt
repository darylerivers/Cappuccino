1. KEY INSIGHTS:
   - The top performers consistently have a lower `base_break_step` compared to the bottom performers, indicating that agents with fewer steps before breaking (or taking a large action) tend to perform better. This suggests that less cautious actions might be more beneficial in this trading environment.
   - There is a slight positive correlation between `norm_action` and performance, where higher normalized actions are associated with better results.
   - The difference in `net_dimension` between top and bottom performers is minimal, suggesting that network size does not significantly impact performance in this context.
   - The `eval_time_gap` parameter seems to have no significant effect on performance, as the top and bottom performers exhibit similar behavior.

2. POTENTIAL ISSUES:
   - There are some NaN (Not a Number) values in the best and worst trial results, which could indicate issues with the agent's decision-making or environment interactions.
   - The standard deviation is relatively high, indicating variability in performance across different trials. This suggests that hyperparameter tuning might be needed to stabilize the agent's behavior.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Decrease `base_break_step`: Lower this value to encourage more冒险 actions rather than conservative ones. A reasonable range could be between 5000 and 20000 steps.
   - Increase `norm_action`: Boost normalized action values to encourage larger, potentially riskier trades. An exploration range of 30000 to 45000 might be beneficial.
   - Keep other parameters unchanged: The minor impact observed for `net_dimension` and `eval_time_gap` suggests that these parameters do not need significant adjustments.

4. SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:
   - Narrow the `norm_action` range to focus on higher values (30000 to 45000) as this might help in balancing exploration and exploitation.
   - Expand the `base_break_step` range to explore a wider range of values, from 2000 to 30000 steps, to find an optimal balance between caution and risk-taking.

5. ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:
   - Consider using a different algorithm that might be more robust for this type of environment, such as PPO with an advantage function adjustment or TD3 with state normalization.
   - Implement curiosity-driven reinforcement learning techniques to encourage the agent to explore new strategies beyond its current knowledge.

These recommendations should help in refining the hyperparameters and potentially improving the overall performance of the cryptocurrency trading DRL agent.
