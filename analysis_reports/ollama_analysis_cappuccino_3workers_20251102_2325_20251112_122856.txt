### KEY INSIGHTS:
1. **Impactful Hyperparameters**:
   - **`base_break_step`**: There is a significant difference between the top and bottom performers, suggesting it is highly influential. Increasing this parameter might help agents better decide when to break out of positions.
   - **`norm_cash_exp`**: The best performing trials have a lower average value than the worst, indicating that managing cash exposure effectively is crucial.
   - **`worker_num`**: This parameter shows variability, but it doesn't seem to be as impactful compared to other parameters. 

2. **Pattern Observations**:
   - Parameters like `base_target_step`, `eval_time_gap`, and `lookback` have relatively small differences between top and bottom performers. These might be more fine-tuned rather than crucial for overall performance.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES:
1. **NAN Values**: There are multiple instances of NaN values in the best performing trials. This indicates that there might be issues with how these parameters interact or with data normalization.
2. **High Variance**: The standard deviation is relatively high, indicating a lot of trial-to-trial variability. This could be due to random factors and might require more consistent hyperparameters.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Fine-Tune `base_break_step`**:
   - Increase the range for this parameter, say from 90000 to 120000, to see if agents can better determine break-out points.
   
2. **Optimize Cash Management**:
   - Experiment with different ranges for `norm_cash_exp`, such as -20 to -5, to ensure the agent handles cash more effectively.

3. **Reduce Variability in `worker_num`**:
   - Keep a consistent number of workers, say 11-12, and monitor if it leads to more stable performance.

4. **Tune Data Normalization**:
   - Revisit data normalization strategies. NaN values suggest potential issues with normalization or feature engineering.
   
5. **Increase Exploration in `base_target_step`**:
   - Introduce exploration techniques like noise addition during training to explore a broader range of target steps.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:
1. **Narrow `base_break_step` Range**:
   - Narrow the range from 90000 to 120000 based on preliminary results.
   
2. **Expand `norm_cash_exp` Range**:
   - Expand the range from -15 to 0 to explore a wider spectrum of cash management strategies.

3. **Maintain Consistent `worker_num`**:
   - Maintain a consistent number of workers (e.g., 11-12) and monitor for stability.

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:
1. **Adaptive Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Implement adaptive hyperparameter optimization techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Randomized Search to explore a broader space more efficiently.
   
2. **Reward Shaping**:
   - Experiment with different reward shaping strategies to better guide the agent towards desired outcomes.

3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**:
   - Consider multi-objective optimization if there are trade-offs between performance metrics like profit and risk management.
