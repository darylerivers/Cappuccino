### 1. KEY INSIGHTS

**Patterns in Hyperparameters:**
- **Action Normalization:** The `norm_action` parameter shows a relatively large difference between top and bottom performers, indicating that this parameter significantly influences the agent's learning stability and performance.
- **Reward and Cash Normalization:** Both `norm_reward_exp` and `norm_cash_exp` show minor differences but still have notable impact on overall performance.
- **Network Dimension:** The `net_dimension` parameter has a slight difference between top and bottom performers, but it's less impactful compared to action normalization.
- **Threads and PPO Epochs:** These parameters also have slight differences, but the effect is minimal.

**Impactful Parameters:**
- `norm_action`: This parameter seems to be most impactful as it significantly affects both performance and stability.
- `net_dimension`, `base_break_step`, `eval_time_gap`, and possibly `thread_num` can also contribute meaningfully to the agent's performance, though their impact is less pronounced.

### 2. POTENTIAL ISSUES

**Red Flags:**
- **NaN Values:** The presence of NaN values (e.g., in Trial #705) suggests that there might be issues with the action selection or evaluation process. This could indicate a problem with the policy gradient computation, leading to numerical instability.
- **Performance Distribution:** The performance distribution is quite narrow with a small standard deviation (0.025428), indicating that most trials are performing very similarly.

### 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Action Normalization Adjustment:**
   - **Explore Different Scaling Factors:** Try different scaling factors for `norm_action`. For instance, try values like 25000 and 19000 to see if it improves performance.
   
2. **Reward and Cash Normalization Tuning:**
   - **Adjust the Exponent Values:** Experiment with slightly different exponents in `norm_reward_exp` and `norm_cash_exp`. For example, try `-14` and `-10` for reward normalization and `-13` and `-12` for cash normalization.

3. **Network Dimension Exploration:**
   - **Try Smaller Network Sizes:** Reduce the network dimension to 1200 or 1100 and observe if it improves performance.
   
4. **Thread Number Optimization:**
   - **Increase Thread Number:** Try increasing `thread_num` to 10, as this might help in better parallelization and potentially improve performance.

5. **PPO Epochs Fine-Tuning:**
   - **Reduce PPO Epochs:** Decrease the number of PPO epochs to around 7 or 6 to see if it stabilizes the training process without compromising performance.

### 4. SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT

**Narrow Parameter Ranges:**
- **Action Normalization:** Narrow down the range of `norm_action` between 21000 and 23000.
- **Network Dimension:** Restrict the network dimension to values between 1200 and 1400.
- **Reward and Cash Normalization Exponents:** Limit the range for `norm_reward_exp` to `-15` to `-10` and for `norm_cash_exp` to `-13` to `-11`.

**Expand Parameter Ranges:**
- **PPO Epochs:** Allow for a broader exploration between 5 and 10 epochs.
- **Base Break and Target Steps:** Explore wider ranges if needed, but the current slight differences are minor.

### 5. ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS

1. **Try A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic):**
   - A2C might offer a different perspective on value function approximation compared to PPO. It could be worth exploring whether it performs better in this environment.
   
2. **Introduce Experience Replay:**
   - While DDPG and SAC inherently use experience replay, if your implementation doesn’t explicitly include it, adding experience replay can help stabilize learning and improve performance.

3. **Experiment with Noisy Net Initialization:**
   - Adding noise to the weights during initialization can sometimes help in stabilizing training in environments where the gradients are very flat.

4. **Implement Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C):**
   - A3C combines ideas from both A2C and DDPG, potentially offering a better balance between exploration and exploitation.

By focusing on these recommendations, you can systematically improve the performance of your cryptocurrency trading DRL agent.
