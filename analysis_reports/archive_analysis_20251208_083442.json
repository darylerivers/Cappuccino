  "ai_insights": "### KEY FINDINGS\n\n1. **High Correlations with Negative Impact**: Several parameters have high negative correlations with the trial value, indicating that their increase negatively impacts performance. These include `norm_tech_exp`, `min_cash_reserve`, `volatility_penalty`, and `learning_rate`.\n   \n2. **Positive Correlations with Performance**: Parameters like `gamma` and `norm_action` show positive correlations with trial value, suggesting that increasing these parameters could lead to better performance.\n\n3. **High-Performing Trials**: The top-performing trials have values around 0.1435, which is significantly higher than the mean of 0.0253. These trials are worth further investigation for insights into their configurations.\n\n### OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe \"overlooked_trials\" data shows that there are several high-performing trials (ranks 1-6) with values around 0.1566, which is notably higher than the mean value of 0.0253. These trials should be reconsidered as they could provide valuable insights into effective configurations.\n\n### PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the correlations and sweet spots:\n\n- **High Negative Correlations**: Focus on reducing `norm_tech_exp` (mean: -15.25, std: 0.689), increasing `min_cash_reserve` (mean: 0.079, std: 0.0436), and decreasing `volatility_penalty` (mean: 0.005765, std: 0.008675).\n- **Positive Correlations**: Increase `gamma` (mean: 0.980665, std: 0.011716) and consider increasing `norm_action` (mean: 23159.334764, std: 2907.375854).\n\n### INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE\n\nBased on the interaction data:\n\n- **High Correlation Between Parameters**: The high correlation between `gamma` and `norm_action` (0.2835) suggests that these parameters work well together. Exploring different combinations of these parameters could yield better results.\n- **Negative Interaction Between `norm_tech_exp` and `min_cash_reserve`**: Their negative correlation (-0.3204) indicates that increasing one might negatively impact the other. Understanding how to balance these two could improve performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Fine-Tune Hyperparameters**: Conduct a hyperparameter tuning process focusing on reducing `norm_tech_exp`, increasing `min_cash_reserve`, and decreasing `volatility_penalty`. Use grid search or random search with cross-validation to find the optimal values for these parameters.\n   \n2. **Explore Parameter Combinations**: Investigate different combinations of `gamma` and `norm_action` to see if there are synergies that can improve performance. This could involve running multiple trials with various combinations of these parameters.\n\n3. **Balance Key Parameters**: Given the negative correlation between `norm_tech_exp` and `min_cash_reserve`, consider a balanced approach where both are optimized simultaneously. This might involve using techniques like gradient descent or evolutionary algorithms to find an optimal balance.\n\nBy focusing on these recommendations, future training runs can be more effective in terms of performance and resource utilization."
