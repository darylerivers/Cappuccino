### 1. KEY INSIGHTS:
- **Top Performers' Hyperparameters**: The top-performing trials (Trials #1575, #1658, etc.) have a higher average `base_break_step` and `base_target_step`, as well as a slightly lower `eval_time_gap`. This suggests that more frequent breaks in training can lead to better performance.
- **Impactful Hyperparameters**: The most impactful hyperparameters seem to be `base_break_step`, `norm_action`, and `worker_num`. These parameters show the largest differences between top and bottom performers.

### 2. POTENTIAL ISSUES:
- **High Failure Rate**: With 6 out of 1749 trials failing, there might be issues with stability or convergence.
- **NaN Values**: The presence of NaN values in some trials indicates potential issues during training, such as exploding gradients or numerical instability.
- **Overfitting Risk**: Despite the high average value of 0.035536, the standard deviation (0.030378) suggests that the model might be too sensitive to the data and could overfit.

### 3. RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Reduce `base_target_step`**: Since top performers have a lower `base_target_step`, reducing it slightly might help in stabilizing training.
2. **Increase `thread_num`**: The top performers average a higher number of threads, which suggests that increasing this parameter could improve parallelization and thus training speed.
3. **Adjust `eval_time_gap`**: Reducing the `eval_time_gap` from 60 to 45 or 50 might help in making the evaluation process more frequent, providing better insights during training.
4. **Fine-tune `batch_size`**: Since top performers have a batch size of 1, experimenting with smaller batch sizes (e.g., 8 or 12) could help in stabilizing the gradient updates.
5. **Reduce `worker_num`**: The top performers average fewer workers, which might reduce overhead and improve model stability.

### 4. SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:
- **Narrow `base_break_step` Range**: Consider narrowing down the range of `base_break_step` to values around 90000 to 125000.
- **Expand `thread_num` Range**: Increase the search space for `thread_num` from 8 to 16 to see if more threads can further improve performance.
- **Narrow `eval_time_gap` Range**: Narrow down the range of `eval_time_gap` to values around 45 to 60.
- **Expand `batch_size` Range**: Try batch sizes between 4 and 12 to find an optimal value.
- **Narrow `worker_num` Range**: Consider narrowing down the range of `worker_num` from 9 to 11.

### 5. ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:
1. **Try a Different Optimizer**: Sometimes, switching to a different optimizer (e.g., AdamW instead of Adam) can help in stabilizing training.
2. **Implement Gradient Clipping**: Adding gradient clipping can help prevent exploding gradients and stabilize training.
3. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Using an adaptive learning rate scheduler (e.g., ReduceLROnPlateau) might help in finding a better learning rate during training.
4. **Try TD3 or SAC**: If PPO is not performing well, consider experimenting with other algorithms like Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), which might offer different strengths for this type of problem.

### Summary:
By focusing on these hyperparameter changes and refining the search space, you should be able to identify a more stable and effective configuration for your DRL agent in the cryptocurrency trading environment. Additionally, exploring alternative algorithms could provide further improvements if needed.
