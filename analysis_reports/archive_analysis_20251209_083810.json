  "ai_insights": "1. **KEY FINDINGS**:\n   - The most significant negative correlations are observed between \"norm_tech_exp\" and parameters like \"min_cash_reserve\", \"volatility_penalty\", and \"learning_rate\". This suggests that high technical expertise (low norm_tech_exp) is negatively correlated with low cash reserves, high volatility penalties, and high learning rates.\n   - Positive correlations exist between \"norm_tech_exp\" and \"gamma\" as well as \"norm_action\" and \"gamma\". This indicates that higher technical expertise and more aggressive actions are positively associated with a higher discount factor (gamma).\n   - The parameter \"min_cash_reserve\" has the highest mean value among all parameters, indicating that maintaining a minimum cash reserve is crucial for performance.\n\n2. **OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES**:\n   - Yes, there are high-performing configurations that should be reconsidered. Specifically, trials numbered 191, 192, and 26 have values significantly higher than the mean (0.156558, 0.156517, and 0.156289). These configurations rank in the top 3 overall but are currently overlooked.\n\n3. **PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS**:\n   - Based on the correlations and sweet spots, future training should focus on parameter ranges that align with high performance. For instance:\n     - \"norm_tech_exp\": The mean value is -15.246862 with a standard deviation of 0.681652, suggesting values between -17.0 and -13.0 are optimal.\n     - \"min_cash_reserve\": A minimum cash reserve of around 0.0786 (mean value) is ideal.\n     - \"norm_action\": Values around 23,000 to 25,000 for the norm_action parameter could be beneficial.\n\n4. **INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE**:\n   - The interaction data suggests promising combinations such as:\n     - High technical expertise (\"norm_tech_exp\") with low volatility penalties (\"volatility_penalty\").\n     - High technical expertise with a moderate discount factor (\"gamma\").\n     - High technical expertise and more aggressive actions (\"norm_action\").\n\n5. **ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS**:\n   - **Focus on High-Performing Configurations**: Given the high values of trials 191, 192, and 26, it is crucial to revisit these configurations to understand their specific conditions and replicate or improve upon them.\n   - **Optimize Parameter Ranges**: Based on the sweet spots identified, narrow down the parameter ranges for \"norm_tech_exp\", \"min_cash_reserve\", and \"norm_action\" to focus future training efforts more effectively.\n   - **Explore Promising Interactions**: Investigate further into high-performing interactions such as combining low volatility penalties with high technical expertise to enhance overall performance."
