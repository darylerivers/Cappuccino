### KEY INSIGHTS

1. **base_break_step**: Top performers have a lower average value (84,000) compared to bottom performers (88,000), indicating they might be more sensitive or adaptive to breaking conditions in the environment.
2. **norm_action**: The mean difference between top and bottom performers is positive (3,200), suggesting that normalizing actions can help stabilize the agent's behavior.
3. **net_dimension**: Bottom performers have a slightly higher average network dimension (1497.6) than top performers (1280). This might imply that larger networks are less beneficial or more prone to overfitting.
4. **base_target_step**: Top performers take fewer steps to reach their targets compared to bottom performers, suggesting they might be more efficient in achieving objectives.
5. **eval_time_gap**: The difference is negative (9), indicating that top performers evaluate their performance less frequently than bottom performers, possibly leading to higher instability or lack of convergence.
6. **norm_reward_exp**: Top performers have a slightly higher average normalized reward exponent (-9.1) compared to bottom performers (-10.5), which might indicate they are more sensitive to extreme rewards.
7. **thread_num**: The top performers use more threads (13.5) than the bottom performers (12.3), suggesting that parallelization can improve performance.
8. **ppo_epochs**: Bottom performers have a slightly higher number of PPO epochs (10.8) compared to top performers (10), indicating they might benefit from fewer iterations.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES

1. **NaN Values**: The presence of NaN values in the best value indicates potential issues with data handling or normalization.
2. **High Std Dev and Failure Rate**: Despite having a mean and median that are positive, the high standard deviation (0.033521) and relatively high failure rate (9 out of 4651 trials) suggest inconsistent performance.
3. **Performance Variability**: The significant difference in performance between top and bottom performers (best value: 0.073734, worst value: -0.116391) indicates variability that needs to be addressed.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Reduce `base_break_step`**: Lower the average `base_break_step` to match the top performers' lower values (e.g., around 80,000). This could improve adaptability.
2. **Increase `norm_action`**: Normalize actions more aggressively (e.g., increase the value to around 35,000) to stabilize the agent's behavior.
3. **Optimize Network Size**: Experiment with a smaller network size for top performers (e.g., reduce net_dimension to around 1200) to see if it improves stability and generalization.
4. **Reduce `eval_time_gap`**: Increase the frequency of evaluations for bottom performers (e.g., set eval_time_gap to around 75) to improve convergence and stability.
5. **Fine-tune PPO Epochs**: Reduce the number of epochs for top performers (e.g., decrease ppo_epochs to around 8) to balance between exploration and exploitation.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT

1. **Reduce `net_dimension` Range**: Narrow the range for `net_dimension` from 1024 to 1536 to focus on values that performed well.
2. **Adjust `base_break_step` Range**: Expand the range for `base_break_step` from 75,000 to 90,000 to explore a broader range of breaking conditions.
3. **Refine `eval_time_gap` Range**: Narrow the range for `eval_time_gap` from 45 to 80 to concentrate on values that improved performance.

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS

1. **Try PPO with Different Clipping Ratios**: Experiment with different clipping ratios in PPO (e.g., 0.2 and 0.3) to see if they improve stability.
2. **Combine SAC with TD3**: Consider combining SAC's exploration strategy with TD3's value function approximation to leverage their strengths.

By implementing these recommendations, you should be able to refine the hyperparameters and potentially improve the overall performance of your DRL agent in cryptocurrency trading environments.
