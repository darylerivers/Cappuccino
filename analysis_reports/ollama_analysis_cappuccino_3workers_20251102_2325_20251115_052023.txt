### KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Base Break Step**: The difference between the top and bottom performers in `base_break_step` is significant, with an average of 27,000 less for the top performers. This suggests that a lower `base_break_step` value can lead to better performance.
   
2. **Normalization Action**: There's a slight improvement with normalization, where the top performers have a slightly higher mean (`24800`) compared to the bottom performers (`23800`). However, this difference is relatively small.

3. **Network Dimension**: The network dimension for the top and bottom performers is different, but it seems less critical as both groups perform well with slightly different values.

4. **Evaluation Time Gap**: A smaller evaluation time gap (60 vs 63) can be beneficial, as it might allow for more frequent evaluations and adjustments during training.

5. **Normalization Cash Exp and Reward Exp**: These parameters show minor differences between top and bottom performers but are not significantly impactful in the observed data.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES

1. **NaN Values**: The presence of NaN values in the top-performing trials indicates potential issues with the agent's performance or computation during these trials. This could be due to numerical instability, policy degeneration, or other internal errors.

2. **Low Batch Size**: A batch size of 1 for both top and bottom performers is quite small. Smaller batch sizes might lead to noisy gradients, which can hinder learning stability.

3. **Worker Number**: The slight difference in worker number (12.2 vs 12.5) between top and bottom performers indicates that more workers could potentially improve performance.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Decrease `base_break_step`**: Try values closer to the lower end of its range, around 60,000 - 70,000.
   
2. **Increase Batch Size**: Consider larger batch sizes, such as 4 or 8, to stabilize gradient updates and potentially improve convergence.

3. **Explore More Workers**: Increase the number of workers to 15-20 to leverage more parallel computing resources and potentially increase learning efficiency.

4. **Reduce Evaluation Time Gap**: Decrease the evaluation time gap to 30 seconds to allow for more frequent evaluations during training.

5. **Fix NaN Issues**: Investigate the source of NaN values in top-performing trials, which could involve debugging or adjusting the agent's behavior during these events.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT

1. **Batch Size**: Narrow down the search space to [4, 8] from a broader range.

2. **Worker Number**: Expand the range to [15, 20] to explore higher levels of parallelism.

3. **Evaluation Time Gap**: Adjust to a smaller range, such as [30, 60], and see if it improves performance.

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Consider combining PPO with another algorithm like DDPG or TD3 for hybrid reinforcement learning to leverage the strengths of both methods.

2. **Entropy Coefficient Tuning**: Experiment with different entropy coefficients in PPO to encourage exploration and potentially stabilize the agent's policy.

3. **Learning Rate Annealing**: Implement learning rate annealing to gradually reduce the learning rate during training, which can help in stabilizing convergence.

By focusing on these specific hyperparameter changes and adjustments, you should be able to identify further improvements in your DRL agent’s performance for cryptocurrency trading.
