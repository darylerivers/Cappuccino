### KEY INSIGHTS:

1. **Base Break Step**: The top performers have a lower `base_break_step` compared to the bottom performers, indicating that they are more likely to break through their current strategies earlier. This suggests that breaking through existing strategies quickly might be beneficial.

2. **Normalization of Actions**: The `norm_action` parameter for top performers is higher, which implies that they are better at normalizing actions, leading to more effective trading decisions.

3. **Network Dimension and Base Target Step**: The network dimension and base target step have slightly different values between top and bottom performers. However, the difference is not significant enough to be a major driver of performance.

4. **Evaluation Time Gap**: Top performers evaluate their strategies less frequently, which might indicate that they are more stable and require fewer evaluations for improvement.

5. **Normalization of Cash Expenditure**: The normalization of cash expenditure (`norm_cash_exp`) shows a slight positive difference between top and bottom performers, suggesting that better management of cash could be beneficial.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES:

1. **NaN Values**: There is one trial with a `nan` value, which suggests that there might be an issue with the agent's decision-making process or environment interaction leading to undefined results.

2. **Low Batch Size and Workers**: The low batch size (`batch_size = 1`) and worker number (`worker_num = 12`) indicate that the model is not being trained on a large enough batch of data, which could lead to suboptimal performance.

3. **Lookback Period**: The lookback period is relatively short for cryptocurrency trading, which might limit the agent's ability to learn long-term patterns and make informed decisions based on historical data.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Increase Batch Size**: Try increasing the `batch_size` to a higher value (e.g., 32 or 64) to allow the model to learn from more diverse data samples.

2. **Reduce Worker Number**: Reducing the `worker_num` to around 8 might help balance between exploration and exploitation, potentially leading to more stable performance.

3. **Adjust Evaluation Time Gap**: Consider increasing the evaluation time gap (`eval_time_gap`) slightly to provide more frequent updates on the agent's performance and stability.

4. **Increase Lookback Period**: Expanding the lookback period to 5 or even 10 days could give the agent a better understanding of market trends and improve decision-making.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:

1. **Batch Size**: Narrow down the range for `batch_size` from its current value to higher values (e.g., `[8, 32, 64]`) to find the optimal batch size.

2. **Worker Number**: Expand the range for `worker_num` slightly to see if increasing it could improve performance (e.g., `[5, 10, 12]`).

3. **Evaluation Time Gap**: Narrow down the range for `eval_time_gap` to ensure frequent enough updates without overburdening the training process (e.g., `[45, 60, 75]`).

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:

1. **Try PPO with a Different Optimizer**: Explore using a different optimizer such as AdamW or RMSprop within the PPO algorithm to see if it improves convergence and performance.

2. **Introduce Experience Replay**: If not already used, consider incorporating experience replay in your DRL agent to help stabilize learning by reusing past experiences.

3. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Implement an adaptive learning rate scheduler that adjusts based on performance metrics to potentially improve training efficiency.

By focusing on these recommendations, you can fine-tune the hyperparameters and potentially see improvements in the overall performance of your cryptocurrency trading DRL agent.
