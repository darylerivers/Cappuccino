  "ai_insights": "1. **KEY FINDINGS**:\n   - The correlation between `gamma` and `norm_tech_exp` is particularly strong at `-0.4124`, indicating that higher gamma values are associated with lower normalized technical indicators, which might suggest a more conservative trading strategy.\n   - The parameter `norm_action` has the highest mean value among all parameters, suggesting it plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the trading actions taken by the model.\n   - The parameter `gamma` also shows a high mean value (0.9807), indicating that the discount factor is set relatively high, which could lead to more long-term considerations in trading decisions.\n\n2. **OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES**:\n   - Based on the \"overlooked_trials\" data, trials 191 and 192 have significantly higher values (0.156558 and 0.156517 respectively) compared to the mean value of 0.020334. These high-performing configurations should be reconsidered as they could provide valuable insights into what parameters work well for cryptocurrency trading.\n\n3. **PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS**:\n   - For `gamma`, focus on values between 0.95 and 1.00, as this range has the highest mean value (0.9807) and a relatively low standard deviation (0.011946).\n   - For `norm_tech_exp`, aim for values around -15.22, which is the mean of its distribution.\n   - For `norm_action`, target values between 23,000 and 25,000, as this range has the highest mean value (23,156.53) and a relatively low standard deviation (3,096.08).\n\n4. **INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE**:\n   - The combination of `gamma` and `norm_tech_exp` seems promising due to their strong negative correlation (-0.4124). Exploring different values within these ranges could lead to improved performance.\n   - The interaction between `norm_action` and `volatility_penalty` also shows a moderate positive correlation (0.2813), indicating that higher normalized action values might be more effective when volatility penalties are lower.\n\n5. **ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS**:\n   - **Increase the Ensemble Size**: Given that the current ensemble size is 20, increasing it to 30 or more could help in capturing a wider range of strategies and potentially improving overall performance.\n   - **Fine-Tune `gamma` and `norm_tech_exp`**: Based on their strong correlation and high mean values, fine-tuning these parameters within the recommended ranges (0.95-1.00 for gamma and around -15.22 for norm_tech_exp) could lead to significant improvements.\n   - **Monitor `norm_action` and `volatility_penalty`**: Since they show a moderate positive correlation, closely monitoring how changes in these parameters affect the model's performance could help in optimizing them further.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future training runs can potentially achieve higher value outcomes for cryptocurrency trading."
