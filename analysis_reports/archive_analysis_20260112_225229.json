  "ai_insights": "1. KEY FINDINGS:\n   - The most significant negative correlation is between \"min_cash_reserve\" and \"gamma\", indicating that as the minimum cash reserve increases, gamma decreases.\n   - \"norm_action\" has a positive correlation with both \"gamma\" and \"norm_tech_exp\", suggesting that these parameters work well together in optimizing action normalization.\n   - \"volatility_penalty\" shows a negative correlation with multiple parameters, including \"min_cash_reserve\", indicating that higher volatility penalties can negatively impact the performance of other parameters.\n\n2. OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n   - The top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) have values significantly higher than the mean and standard deviation of the dataset. These high-performing configurations should be reconsidered as they may offer valuable insights into optimal parameter settings.\n\n3. PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n   - Future training should focus on parameters within their sweet spots to maximize performance. For instance, \"min_cash_reserve\" should be between 0.086 and 0.25, \"gamma\" around 0.981, and \"norm_action\" between 23160.6 and 25000.0.\n   - Parameters with negative correlations (like \"volatility_penalty\") should be adjusted to lower values if possible, as they negatively impact performance.\n\n4. INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n   - The interaction between \"gamma\" and \"norm_tech_exp\" has a strong negative correlation (-0.3633), suggesting that optimizing these two parameters together could lead to better results.\n   - Exploring the combination of \"min_cash_reserve\" with \"norm_action\" (both positively correlated) might also yield improved performance.\n\n5. ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n   - **Parameter Tuning**: Implement a more refined parameter tuning process, focusing on the sweet spots identified for each parameter to ensure optimal settings.\n   - **Hyperparameter Search**: Use advanced hyperparameter search techniques like Randomized Search or Bayesian Optimization to explore the high-performing configurations found in \"overlooked_trials\".\n   - **Model Architecture Review**: Revisit and potentially refine the model architecture, especially considering that some parameters have strong negative correlations with others, which might indicate potential issues with how these parameters interact within the model."
