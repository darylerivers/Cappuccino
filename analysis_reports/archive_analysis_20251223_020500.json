  "ai_insights": "1. KEY FINDINGS:\n   - The most significant correlation identified is between \"gamma\" and \"norm_action\" with a value of 0.3395.\n   - Negative correlations are observed between \"gamma\" and \"volatility_penalty\", \"min_cash_reserve\", and \"norm_tech_exp\".\n   - The parameter \"gamma\" has a sweet spot with a mean value of 0.9807 and a standard deviation of 0.011946, indicating that values closer to 1 are generally better.\n   - The top-performing trials have an average value of 0.143452, significantly higher than the overall mean of 0.019977.\n\n2. OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n   - Trial number 191 has a value of 0.156558 and is ranked first overall, indicating it could be reconsidered for further exploration or optimization.\n   - Trial numbers 192 through 190 also have high values ranging from 0.1434 to 0.1565, suggesting they might contain valuable insights that were not fully utilized.\n\n3. PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n   - Future training should focus on parameter ranges where \"gamma\" is close to 1 (e.g., between 0.98 and 0.99).\n   - For \"norm_action\", values around the mean of 23,156.53 are recommended.\n   - Negative values for \"volatility_penalty\" should be avoided, as they negatively impact performance.\n\n4. INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n   - The interaction between \"gamma\" and \"norm_tech_exp\" is promising with a correlation of -0.3161, indicating that optimizing both parameters together could lead to better results.\n   - Exploring the relationship between \"volatility_penalty\" and \"min_cash_reserve\" might also reveal synergies that improve performance.\n\n5. ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n   - Increase the number of trials focusing on high-performing parameter configurations like those in trial numbers 191 through 190.\n   - Implement a more aggressive exploration strategy for the \"gamma\" and \"norm_action\" parameters, as they show significant potential for improvement.\n   - Introduce additional trials that specifically target the optimal ranges identified for \"volatility_penalty\" and \"min_cash_reserve\" to mitigate their negative impact on performance."
