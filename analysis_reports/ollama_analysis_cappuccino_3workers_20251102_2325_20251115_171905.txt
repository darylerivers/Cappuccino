### KEY INSIGHTS:

1. **Base Break Step**:
   - Top performers have a higher `base_break_step` value, indicating they might be more aggressive in breaking through price barriers.

2. **Norm Action**:
   - The top performers normalize actions around 25000, which suggests that the agents are performing better when their action space is normalized around this point.

3. **Net Dimension**:
   - The bottom performers have a larger `net_dimension` (1548.8), which might indicate they are overfitting or less efficient due to having more complex networks.

4. **Base Target Step**:
   - Both top and bottom performers have similar values for `base_target_step`, suggesting that this parameter does not significantly affect performance here.

5. **Eval Time Gap**:
   - Top performers have a slightly shorter evaluation time gap (60 seconds), which could be beneficial for maintaining performance during evaluations.

6. **Norm Cash Exp**:
   - Both top and bottom performers have similar values for `norm_cash_exp`, indicating that this parameter might not significantly affect the agents' performance in this context.

7. **Worker Num**:
   - Top performers have slightly fewer workers (12.8), which could indicate a more efficient use of resources or less contention between agents.

8. **Thread Num**:
   - Both top and bottom performers have similar values for `thread_num`, suggesting that this parameter might not significantly affect performance here.

9. **PPO Epochs**:
   - Top performers have slightly more epochs (9.8), which could indicate a better balance between exploration and exploitation.

10. **Norm Reward Exp**:
    - Both top and bottom performers have similar values for `norm_reward_exp`, suggesting that this parameter might not significantly affect performance here.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES:

1. **Failed Trials**:
   - There are 9 failed trials, which could indicate issues with the environment setup or initialization of the agents.

2. **Outliers in Top Performers**:
   - Trial #2524 and Trial #3364 have `nan` values for the performance metric, which suggests potential issues with these specific trials.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation Balance**:
   - Increase `base_break_step` slightly to allow more aggressive trading strategies.
   
2. **Network Complexity**:
   - Decrease `net_dimension` to reduce overfitting and simplify the model.
   
3. **Evaluation Time Gap**:
   - Maintain the current evaluation time gap of 60 seconds.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:

1. **Base Break Step**:
   - Narrow the range slightly: `[82000, 86000]`
   
2. **Net Dimension**:
   - Expand the range to explore simpler networks: `[1000, 1500]`

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:

1. **Try A2C Algorithm**:
   - A2C might provide a good balance between value and policy gradients, which could improve performance.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning with Bayesian Optimization**:
   - Use Bayesian optimization to find the optimal hyperparameters within the refined search space. This can be particularly useful given the complexity of financial trading environments.
