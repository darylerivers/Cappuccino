### 1. KEY INSIGHTS:

- **Hyperparameter Impact**: 
  - `base_break_step` shows a significant difference between top and bottom performers, with an average difference of -8000.
  - `norm_action`, `net_dimension`, and `base_target_step` also exhibit notable differences, although to a lesser extent.
  - `eval_time_gap`, `norm_reward_exp`, `thread_num`, `worker_num`, `norm_cash_exp`, and `ppo_epochs` show less variation.

- **Top Performers Characteristics**:
  - Top performers have higher values for `base_break_step` (85000 vs. 93000), lower values for `net_dimension` (1280 vs. 1497.6), and slightly better reward normalization parameters.

### 2. POTENTIAL ISSUES:

- **NaN Values**: There are NaN values in the best value, which could indicate issues with the data or algorithmic problems.
- **Overfitting**: The small difference in average performance between top and bottom performers (0.15) suggests that there might be some overfitting if the variance is too high.
- **Redundant Parameters**: Some parameters (`norm_action`, `base_target_step`, `eval_time_gap`, `norm_reward_exp`, `thread_num`, `worker_num`) show minimal variation, indicating potential redundancy or lack of sensitivity to these parameters.

### 3. RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Hyperparameter Exploration**:
   - Increase the range for `base_break_step` to explore if higher values can consistently improve performance.
   
2. **Reduce Redundant Parameters**:
   - Simplify the hyperparameter search space by removing or combining redundant parameters.

3. **Reward Normalization Adjustments**:
   - Try different values for `norm_reward_exp`, possibly shifting towards less negative values if the current set is too extreme.

4. **Algorithmic Experimentation**:
   - Consider trying a different algorithm, such as A2C, to see if it performs better with these hyperparameters or if it reveals new insights.

5. **Data Quality Check**:
   - Investigate the NaN values and ensure data quality. Ensure that the environment is correctly set up and that there are no issues with the initial state or transitions.

### 4. SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:

- **Expand `base_break_step` Range**: Try a wider range, e.g., from 60000 to 120000.
- **Simplify Redundant Parameters**:
  - Remove `eval_time_gap`, `thread_num`, and `worker_num` if they are not showing significant differences.

### 5. ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:

- **A2C**: Try using the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, which is simpler than PPO but might still perform well or reveal new insights.
- **Baseline Algorithms**: Consider trying more basic algorithms like DQN to understand if the problem lies in the complexity of the model rather than the optimization process.

By focusing on these recommendations, you can potentially uncover new hyperparameter settings that lead to improved performance and address any issues identified during this analysis.
