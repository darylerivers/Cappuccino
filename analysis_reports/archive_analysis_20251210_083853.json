  "ai_insights": "1. KEY FINDINGS:\n   - The most significant negative correlations are observed between \"norm_tech_exp\" and \"min_cash_reserve\", \"gamma\", and \"volatility_penalty\". This suggests that having a lower technical expertise score, less cash reserve, and higher gamma (discount factor) negatively impacts the performance.\n   - Positive correlations indicate that parameters like \"norm_action\" and \"gamma\" have a positive impact on performance. However, these are not as strong as the negative correlations.\n\n2. OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n   - The top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) have values significantly higher than the mean value of 0.024243. These high-performing configurations should be reconsidered as they might contain valuable insights that could improve future training outcomes.\n\n3. PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n   - For \"norm_tech_exp\", focus on values between -18.0 and -15.0, which are within the sweet spot identified.\n   - For \"min_cash_reserve\", aim for values around 0.0782 (mean) with a slight adjustment based on the standard deviation of 0.0432.\n   - For \"norm_action\", target values between 9000.0 and 25000.0, which are within the identified sweet spot.\n\n4. INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n   - The interaction between \"norm_tech_exp\" and \"gamma\" shows a strong negative correlation (-0.4067), indicating that these parameters should be carefully balanced.\n   - The positive correlation between \"norm_action\" and \"gamma\" (0.3145) suggests that increasing both might improve performance.\n\n5. ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct a more detailed hyperparameter tuning for \"norm_tech_exp\", \"min_cash_reserve\", and \"gamma\". Focus on the identified sweet spots to find the optimal combination.\n   - **Parameter Balance**: Pay special attention to balancing \"norm_tech_exp\" and \"gamma\". Consider implementing strategies that dynamically adjust these parameters based on the current market conditions.\n   - **Performance Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring of the training process. Use the insights from the overlooked trials to set up alerts for configurations that deviate significantly from the mean, allowing for quick intervention if necessary."
