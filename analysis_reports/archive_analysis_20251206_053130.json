  "ai_insights": "### KEY FINDINGS\n\n1. **High Correlation Between Parameters**:\n   - Several parameters exhibit high correlations with each other, indicating that changes in one parameter can significantly affect others. For example, `norm_tech_exp` and `gamma` have a correlation of `-0.3806`, suggesting that optimizing these two together could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Positive Correlation Between Performance and Parameters**:\n   - Some parameters show a positive correlation with the performance value, indicating that increasing their values can lead to better results. For instance, `norm_cash_exp` has a positive correlation of `0.0117`.\n\n3. **Negative Correlation Between Performance and Parameters**:\n   - Conversely, some parameters have a negative correlation with performance, meaning that increasing these values could negatively impact the model's performance. An example is `volatility_penalty`, which has a correlation of `-0.2594`.\n\n### OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES\n\n1. **High-Performing Configurations**:\n   - The \"overlooked_trials\" data shows several high-performing configurations with values above 0.15. For example, trial number 191 has a value of 0.156558 and is ranked overall at position 1. These configurations should be reconsidered as they may offer valuable insights into what works well.\n\n### PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. **Focus on `norm_tech_exp`**:\n   - Given its high negative correlation with performance, it's crucial to fine-tune this parameter within the range of `-18.0` to `-15.0`. The mean value is `-15.26`, indicating that values closer to the upper end of this range might yield better results.\n\n2. **Optimize `gamma`**:\n   - With a correlation of `-0.3806`, optimizing `gamma` within its range of `0.89` to `0.99` could significantly improve performance. The mean value is `0.9805`, suggesting that values closer to the upper end might be beneficial.\n\n3. **Adjust `norm_cash_exp`**:\n   - Although it has a positive correlation of `0.0117`, further exploration within its range of `-0.1164` to `0.1565` could reveal optimal settings that enhance performance.\n\n### INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE\n\n1. **Combination of `norm_tech_exp` and `gamma`**:\n   - Given their high correlation, exploring different combinations of these parameters could lead to significant improvements in performance.\n\n2. **Exploring `min_cash_reserve` and `volatility_penalty` Together**:\n   - Both have negative correlations with performance, and their interaction might reveal a synergistic effect that could be beneficial when tuned together.\n\n3. **Combining `norm_tech_exp`, `gamma`, and `volatility_penalty`**:\n   - This combination of parameters shows significant interdependencies and could yield unexpected improvements when optimized collectively.\n\n### ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Fine-Tune `norm_tech_exp` and `gamma` Together**:\n   - Conduct a grid search or random search within the specified ranges for these two parameters to identify optimal combinations that maximize performance.\n\n2. **Revisit High-Performing Configurations**:\n   - Investigate the specific configurations identified in the \"overlooked_trials\" data to understand what makes them successful and incorporate their insights into future training runs.\n\n3. **Monitor `norm_cash_exp` for Positive Impact**:\n   - Although it has a positive correlation, continue monitoring its impact during training to ensure that any adjustments lead to performance improvements rather than degradation.\n\nBy focusing on these key findings, overlooked opportunities, parameter recommendations, interactions to explore, and actionable suggestions, future training runs can be optimized for better performance in cryptocurrency trading."
