  "ai_insights": "### KEY FINDINGS\n\n1. **High Correlations with Performance**: The parameter `gamma` has a strong positive correlation (0.3561) with performance, indicating that higher gamma values lead to better outcomes.\n2. **Negative Correlations with Negative Impact**: Parameters like `min_cash_reserve`, `norm_tech_exp`, and `volatility_penalty` have negative correlations with performance, suggesting that lower values for these parameters are beneficial.\n3. **Parameter Sweet Spots**: The mean and standard deviation values provide a range within which parameter settings should be optimized for better performance.\n\n### OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe \"overlooked_trials\" data shows that the top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) have significantly higher values compared to the mean. These high-performing configurations are currently being overlooked, and it would be beneficial to revisit these trials to understand why they performed so well.\n\n### PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the correlations and sweet spots:\n\n- **Gamma**: Focus on values between 0.98 and 0.99.\n- **Min Cash Reserve**: Aim for values between 0.03 and 0.25.\n- **Norm Action**: Target values around 23,156 (mean) with a tolerance of \u00b12,977.\n\n### INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE\n\nThe parameter combinations that seem promising based on the interaction data:\n\n1. **Gamma and Norm Action**: High positive correlation (0.3589).\n2. **Gamma and Min Cash Reserve**: Negative correlation (-0.34).\n3. **Min Cash Reserve and Norm Tech Exp**: Positive correlation (0.3118).\n\n### ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Revisit Overlooked Trials**: Investigate the top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) to understand their unique configurations and extract insights that can be applied to future training runs.\n   \n2. **Fine-tune Hyperparameters**: Based on the parameter sweet spots, fine-tune hyperparameters such as `gamma`, `min_cash_reserve`, and `norm_action` within their respective ranges (0.98-0.99 for gamma, 0.03-0.25 for min_cash_reserve, and around 23,156 for norm_action) to maximize performance.\n\n3. **Explore Promising Interactions**: Experiment with parameter combinations that show strong correlations, such as `gamma` and `norm_action`, to see if further optimization can be achieved by tweaking these interactions.\n\nBy following these recommendations, future training runs can be more focused on high-performing configurations and better understand the relationships between parameters for improved performance."
