1. **KEY INSIGHTS**:
   - The top performers have a consistently higher `norm_action` value compared to the bottom performers, which indicates that well-performing trials tend to take more actions within their normalization range.
   - The `base_break_step` value for top performers is slightly lower than for bottom performers. This suggests that top agents might be making fewer breaks during training.
   - The `net_dimension` and `base_target_step` have minimal differences between top and bottom performers, implying that these parameters may not significantly impact performance in this specific setup.

2. **POTENTIAL ISSUES**:
   - There are some failures (9 out of 4344 trials), which indicates potential issues with the training environment or hyperparameter settings.
   - The presence of `nan` values in the top performers' trial results could be due to numerical instability or errors during execution. It's crucial to investigate these instances further.

3. **RECOMMENDATIONS**:
   - **Increase `base_break_step`**: Since top performers have lower `base_break_step` values, increasing this parameter might allow agents to continue learning for longer periods without breaking.
   - **Adjust `thread_num`**: The difference in `thread_num` between top and bottom performers is minimal. Experimenting with a slightly higher number of threads could potentially speed up training without overloading resources.
   - **Tune `norm_reward_exp`**: The small positive difference in `norm_reward_exp` indicates that this parameter might not be a major issue, but ensuring consistent reward scaling could stabilize learning.
   - **Increase `worker_num`**: Exploring a slightly higher number of workers (e.g., 16) might provide more parallelism and could help in stabilizing the training process.

4. **SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT**:
   - **Expand `base_break_step` range**: Consider expanding the range for this parameter to explore longer training times.
   - **Narrow `norm_action` range**: If increasing `base_break_step` does not improve performance, narrowing the `norm_action` range might help in stabilizing action values.

5. **ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS**:
   - **Try A2C Algorithm**: Since PPO and SAC are based on actor-critic methods, exploring A2C could provide a different perspective.
   - **Hyperparameter Optimization Techniques**: Consider using more advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Randomized Search to find better combinations of parameters.

In summary, focusing on `base_break_step`, `thread_num`, and potentially `worker_num` might yield improvements. Additionally, exploring alternative algorithms like A2C could be beneficial.
