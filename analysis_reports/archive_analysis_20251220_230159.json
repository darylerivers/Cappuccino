  "ai_insights": "1. KEY FINDINGS:\n   - The most important patterns observed are the strong correlations between parameters such as \"gamma\" with \"norm_tech_exp\" (-0.4082) and \"norm_action\" (0.3405), indicating that these parameters significantly influence each other.\n   - Negative correlations suggest that increasing one parameter while decreasing another can improve performance, e.g., \"volatility_penalty\" and \"gamma\" (-0.3083).\n   - High-performing trials (top 20) have a mean value of 0.143452, which is notably higher than the overall mean value of 0.020164.\n\n2. OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n   - Yes, there are high-performing configurations that should be reconsidered. The \"overlooked_trials\" list shows trials with values above the mean, indicating they might have been overlooked due to their lower ranks or other factors.\n   - Specifically, trial number 191 has a value of 0.156558 and is ranked overall as the best (rank_overall: 1), suggesting it could be a valuable configuration for further exploration.\n\n3. PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n   - Based on the parameter sweet spots:\n     - \"gamma\" should be set between 0.98 and 0.99.\n     - \"norm_tech_exp\" should be around -15.22, with a tolerance of \u00b10.63.\n     - \"norm_action\" should be approximately 23,157, with a tolerance of \u00b13,096.\n\n4. INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n   - Promising parameter combinations include:\n     - Increasing \"gamma\" while decreasing \"volatility_penalty\".\n     - Adjusting \"norm_tech_exp\" and \"norm_action\" together to explore their combined impact on performance.\n     - Experimenting with different ranges of \"min_cash_reserve\" and \"volatility_penalty\" to find the optimal balance.\n\n5. ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n   - **Focus on High-Performing Trials**: Prioritize further exploration of high-performing trials like trial number 191, which has a value significantly above the mean.\n   - **Tune Key Parameters**: Implement parameter tuning strategies focusing on \"gamma\", \"norm_tech_exp\", and \"norm_action\" within their sweet spot ranges to maximize performance.\n   - **Explore Interactions**: Conduct experiments that explore the interactions between parameters like \"gamma\" and \"volatility_penalty\" to identify synergies that could lead to better outcomes."
