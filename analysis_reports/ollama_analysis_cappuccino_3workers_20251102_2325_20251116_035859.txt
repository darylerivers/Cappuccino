### 1. KEY INSIGHTS

**Hyperparameter Patterns:**
- **Base Break Step:** The top performers have a lower `base_break_step` value compared to the bottom performers. This suggests that a lower break step might allow for more frequent adjustments, leading to better performance.
- **Normalization of Actions:** Top performers use a higher normalization constant (`norm_action`) than the bottom performers. This could indicate that the agent benefits from more precise control over actions.
- **Network Dimension:** The network dimension is slightly lower in top performers. Smaller networks can sometimes generalize better and reduce the risk of overfitting, although this may not be universally true depending on the specific task and data.
- **Base Target Step:** There is only a small difference between the average `base_target_step` values of top and bottom performers, indicating that this parameter might not have a significant impact.
- **Evaluation Time Gap:** Top performers have a shorter evaluation time gap (`eval_time_gap`). This could mean they are evaluated more frequently, allowing for better adaptation to changes in the environment.

**Impactful Parameters:**
- `base_break_step`
- `norm_action`
- `net_dimension`

### 2. POTENTIAL ISSUES

**Red Flags and Concerns:**
- **Failed Trials:** There were 9 failed trials out of 3628, which indicates some instability in the training process.
- **NaN Values:** The presence of NaN values suggests issues with data normalization or algorithm behavior, particularly affecting trial #2524, #3559, and #3364. This could be due to incorrect reward calculations, invalid actions, or numerical errors.
- **Performance Variability:** The high standard deviation (0.033104) indicates significant variability in performance across trials, which could indicate noise or suboptimal hyperparameter settings.

### 3. RECOMMENDATIONS

**Hyperparameter Changes to Explore:**
1. **Increase `base_break_step` for Top Performers:** Try increasing the break step slightly above the current average (around 84000) to see if it stabilizes performance and reduces overfitting.
2. **Decrease `net_dimension` for All Performers:** Smaller network dimensions might help reduce complexity and potentially improve generalization, especially if the data is limited or noisy.
3. **Adjust Evaluation Frequency:** Experiment with different `eval_time_gap` values to see if a more balanced frequency leads to better performance and convergence.

### 4. SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT

**Parameter Range Adjustments:**
1. **Base Break Step:** Narrow the range around the current top performer's average (80000-90000).
2. **Network Dimension:** Expand the lower end of the range to include smaller networks (512, 768, 1024) and see how they perform.
3. **Evaluation Time Gap:** Explore a wider range for `eval_time_gap` (e.g., 40-80), to find an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation.

### 5. ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Use a Different Algorithm:** Consider trying TD3 or SAC, which are known for their stability and ability to handle high-dimensional actions and states.
2. **Adaptive Reward Scaling:** Implement adaptive reward scaling techniques that dynamically adjust the rewards based on the agent's performance, potentially helping to mitigate numerical issues.

By focusing on these recommendations, you can refine your hyperparameter search space and potentially improve the overall performance of your DRL agent in cryptocurrency trading environments.
