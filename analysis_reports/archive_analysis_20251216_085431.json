  "ai_insights": "1. KEY FINDINGS:\n   - The most important patterns observed include a high correlation between \"gamma\" and \"norm_action\" (0.356), indicating that these parameters may work well together.\n   - A negative correlation between \"gamma\" and \"volatility_penalty\" (-0.3093) suggests that higher gamma values might be beneficial when volatility penalties are low.\n   - The parameter \"norm_tech_exp\" has a strong negative correlation with both \"min_cash_reserve\" (0.3016) and \"gamma\" (-0.4097), indicating that it may not be optimal to use high levels of technical expertise while maintaining low cash reserves or setting high gamma values.\n\n2. OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n   - There are indeed high-performing configurations, specifically trials 191, 192, and 26, which have values above 0.15. These should be reconsidered for further analysis to understand their unique characteristics that contribute to their success.\n\n3. PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n   - Future training should focus on parameter ranges where \"gamma\" is around 0.98 (mean of 0.980425) and \"norm_action\" is between 21,178 and 25,000 (mean \u00b1 3 standard deviations). This range balances exploration and exploitation.\n   - For \"volatility_penalty,\" a value around 0.006 (mean of 0.006087) might be optimal to avoid excessive risk while maintaining performance.\n\n4. INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n   - The combination of \"gamma\" and \"norm_tech_exp\" seems promising due to their strong negative correlation (-0.4097). Exploring different values within these ranges could lead to improved performance.\n   - Investigating the interaction between \"min_cash_reserve\" and \"norm_tech_exp\" (correlation 0.3016) might reveal optimal strategies for managing cash reserves while utilizing technical expertise.\n\n5. ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n   - **Increase Exploration**: Since there is a positive correlation between \"gamma\" and \"norm_action,\" increasing the exploration phase by allowing higher gamma values could potentially lead to better performance.\n   - **Optimize Cash Management**: Reducing the negative impact of \"min_cash_reserve\" on performance might involve strategies that balance cash reserves with technical expertise.\n   - **Fine-Tune Volatility Penalty**: Experimenting with different volatility penalty settings around the mean value (0.006) could help in finding a balance between risk and return, potentially improving overall performance.\n\nBy focusing on these recommendations, future training runs can be more data-driven and potentially lead to higher performance outcomes."
