### KEY INSIGHTS:
1. **Impactful Hyperparameters**: The hyperparameters `base_break_step`, `norm_action`, `net_dimension`, and `base_target_step` seem to have a significant impact on the agent's performance. Specifically, having a higher `base_break_step` and `net_dimension`, as well as a lower `base_target_step`, correlates with better performance.
2. **Training Consistency**: The mean value of 0.035140 suggests that the agent is performing consistently above average, which is positive. However, the standard deviation (0.032464) indicates that there is some variability in performance across trials.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES:
1. **Nan Values**: The presence of `nan` values in the best value suggests that these specific trials may have encountered issues such as numerical instability or policy collapse.
2. **Performance Variability**: Despite an overall positive mean, the high standard deviation indicates that some trials performed exceptionally well while others underperformed significantly.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Lower `base_target_step`**: Further decrease this parameter to explore if even lower values improve performance. A target step of around 800-900 might be more optimal.
2. **Increase `net_dimension`**: Consider increasing the network dimension from 1280 to a higher value like 2048 or 2560, which could help the agent capture more complex patterns in the data.
3. **Tune `base_break_step` and `norm_action`**: Experiment with different values for these parameters within their current ranges (e.g., adjusting them from 90000 to 100000 or vice versa) to see if there's an optimal setting that performs best.
4. **Reduce `batch_size`**: Try a smaller batch size like 32 to potentially stabilize the training process and improve convergence.
5. **Fine-tune `norm_cash_exp`, `norm_reward_exp`, and `eval_time_gap`**: Experiment with different values around their current means (e.g., adjusting `norm_cash_exp` from -10 to -12 or -8) to see if there's an optimal setting.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:
1. **Narrow `base_break_step` Range**: Focus on a tighter range, e.g., 90000 to 95000.
2. **Expand `net_dimension` Range**: Consider broader ranges, e.g., from 1024 to 3072.
3. **Adjust `batch_size`**: Try different values like 16 or 64.
4. **Tune `norm_cash_exp`, `norm_reward_exp`, and `eval_time_gap`**: Explore values around the current means with a smaller step size (e.g., ±1).

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:
1. **Try TD3 or SAC**: Both of these algorithms can be more stable than PPO, especially for high-dimensional action spaces, which might help in stabilizing the training process.
2. **Ensemble Learning**: Consider running multiple agents with slightly different hyperparameter settings and combining their decisions to potentially improve overall performance and robustness.

By focusing on these recommendations, you should be able to refine your DRL agent's performance and address the identified issues in the training results.
