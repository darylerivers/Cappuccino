### KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Performance Discrepancy**: The top performers have significantly higher values compared to the bottom performers, with a large standard deviation of 0.033209 across all trials.

2. **Hyperparameter Impact**:
   - `base_break_step` and `norm_action` show relatively small differences between top and bottom performers.
   - `net_dimension`, `base_target_step`, and `use_lr_schedule` have a noticeable impact, with differences of around 198.400000, 41.000000, and 0.300000 respectively.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES

1. **Standard Deviation**: The high standard deviation indicates significant variability in performance, which could be due to unstable training or overfitting.

2. **NaN Values**: Some trials resulted in NaN values for the best value, indicating potential issues with the agent's behavior during training.

3. **Low Worker Number**: The average number of workers is 14.000000 (±1.0715), which might be suboptimal if it leads to performance issues or instability.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Increase `base_break_step`**: Since higher values lead to better performance, try increasing the average value of `base_break_step` from 78000 to a higher range, such as [90000, 100000].

2. **Experiment with Learning Rate Schedule**: Given that `use_lr_schedule` has a high impact and the top performers use it, consider trying different learning rate schedules (e.g., linear, cosine annealing) or adjusting the base learning rate.

3. **Tune `net_dimension`**: Since `net_dimension` also shows significant impact, try increasing the average value from 1280 to a higher range, such as [1500, 2048], while keeping other parameters constant for comparison.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT

1. **Narrow `base_break_step` Range**: Focus on refining the range of `base_break_step` around the top performers' average value (78000) to identify if higher or lower values yield better results.

2. **Expand `net_dimension` Range**: Consider a broader range for `net_dimension` to capture any potential sweet spot that may not be within the current range.

3. **Fine-Tune Learning Rate Schedule**: Narrow the learning rate schedule range and experiment with different schedules to see if it improves performance.

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS

1. **Try A2C or PPO+Entropy Regularization**: Experimenting with alternative algorithms like Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) or adding entropy regularization to PPO could provide insights into whether the current algorithm is optimal for this task.

2. **Implement Experience Replay**: If not already used, implementing experience replay can help stabilize training and reduce variance in performance.

3. **Increase Exploration**: Consider increasing exploration techniques such as noise injection or different types of exploration strategies to better explore the state space.

By focusing on these recommendations, you should be able to refine your hyperparameters and potentially improve the overall performance of your cryptocurrency trading DRL agent.
