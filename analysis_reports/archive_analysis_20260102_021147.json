  "ai_insights": "1. **KEY FINDINGS**:\n   - The highest correlation among parameters is between `gamma` and `norm_action`, with a value of 0.3118, indicating that these two parameters have a positive relationship.\n   - Conversely, `gamma` has a strong negative correlation with `min_cash_reserve` (-0.3261) and `norm_tech_exp` (-0.3672), suggesting that higher values of `gamma` might require lower cash reserves and more conservative technical expectations.\n   - The parameter `gamma`, which is crucial for the discount factor in reinforcement learning, has a mean value of 0.9807 with a standard deviation of 0.0119, indicating that it is generally set to high values across trials.\n\n2. **OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES**:\n   - The top-performing configurations are ranked from trial number 191 to 144 with values ranging from 0.156558 to 0.143452. These configurations should be reconsidered as they significantly outperform the mean value of 0.018143.\n   - Specifically, trial numbers 191 and 192 have the highest values (0.156558 and 0.156517 respectively), which are notably higher than the next best performers.\n\n3. **PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS**:\n   - For `gamma`, focus on values around 0.98 to 0.99, as these have been shown to yield high performance.\n   - For `min_cash_reserve`, aim for values between 0.08 and 0.15, which align with the sweet spot mean of 0.086127.\n   - For `norm_action`, target values around 23,000 to 24,000, as this range is optimal based on the sweet spot data.\n\n4. **INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE**:\n   - The interaction between `gamma` and `norm_tech_exp` (-0.3672) suggests that more conservative technical expectations (`norm_tech_exp`) might be beneficial when using higher discount factors (`gamma`). This combination could be explored further.\n   - Similarly, the negative correlation between `min_cash_reserve` and `norm_action` (-0.1088) indicates that these parameters can be tuned together to optimize performance.\n\n5. **ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS**:\n   - **Increase Focus on High-Performing Configurations**: Prioritize trials with values above 0.143452, as they represent significant improvements over the mean.\n   - **Tune `gamma`, `min_cash_reserve`, and `norm_action` Together**: Experiment with combinations of these parameters within their sweet spot ranges to find synergies that could further enhance performance.\n   - **Explore Interactions Between Parameters**: Investigate parameter pairs like (`gamma`, `norm_tech_exp`) and (`min_cash_reserve`, `norm_action`) to identify optimal configurations that leverage the identified correlations."
