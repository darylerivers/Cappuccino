### KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Base Break Step**: Top performers have a higher `base_break_step` value compared to bottom performers, indicating that more episodes need to complete before the training is considered successful.
2. **Normalization of Actions and Cash/Reward Exponents**: Both top and bottom performers seem to use similar normalization values for actions and cash/reward exponents, which suggests this might not be a major factor affecting performance.
3. **Network Dimension**: Top performers have smaller network dimensions compared to bottom performers, indicating that larger networks might not necessarily lead to better performance.
4. **PPO Epochs**: Top performers train for fewer epochs per update, while bottom performers train for more epochs, which could indicate that fewer updates are sufficient for convergence.
5. **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Top performers consistently use a learning rate scheduler, while bottom performers do not, suggesting this might be beneficial for training stability.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES

1. **Failed Trials**: There are 9 failed trials out of 3524 completed trials, which indicates that some configurations may not have been suitable.
2. **Outliers**: The highest and lowest performance values are quite far apart (0.0737 vs -0.1164), suggesting that there might be outliers or a few configurations that did not perform well.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Reduce Network Dimension**:
   - Explore smaller network dimensions (e.g., 512, 256) to see if this improves performance.
   
2. **Adjust PPO Epochs**:
   - Experiment with a higher number of epochs per update (e.g., 10-12) to ensure that the agent has enough updates to converge.

3. **Use Learning Rate Scheduler**:
   - Ensure that all configurations use a learning rate scheduler to stabilize training.

4. **Explore Different Base Break Steps**:
   - Try a range of `base_break_step` values (e.g., 80000-100000) to find the optimal number of episodes before declaring convergence.

5. **Fine-Tune Evaluation Parameters**:
   - Experiment with different evaluation intervals (`eval_time_gap`) and numbers of evaluations to balance training efficiency and performance assessment.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT

1. **Narrow Network Dimension Range**:
   - Narrow down the network dimension range from 2048-512 to a smaller range (e.g., 1280-256) to focus on more compact models.
   
2. **Expand PPO Epochs Range**:
   - Expand the range of PPO epochs from 10-20 to see if higher epochs can improve performance.

3. **Consistent Use of Learning Rate Scheduler**:
   - Ensure that all configurations use a learning rate scheduler by default.

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS

1. **Try TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients)**:
   - TD3 is known for its stability and performance on continuous control tasks, which might be beneficial in financial trading environments.

2. **Experiment with A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**:
   - A2C can be simpler to implement and may offer better sample efficiency compared to PPO, especially if the environment has high-dimensional observations or actions.

3. **Implement a Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combine elements of PPO (e.g., clip objective, value clipping) with TD3's stability features to create a hybrid algorithm that could leverage both benefits.

By focusing on these recommendations, you can refine your hyperparameter search and potentially improve the overall performance of your DRL agent in cryptocurrency trading environments.
