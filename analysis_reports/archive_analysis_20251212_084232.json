This suggests that values around this mean are optimal.\n   - For `norm_tech_exp`, the mean is -15.225191 and the standard deviation is 0.654756, indicating that values close to this mean are preferred.\n\n3. **Top Performers**:\n   - The top performers have a mean value of 0.143452, with trial numbers ranging from 191 to 180. These trials should be closely examined for insights into what configurations lead to high performance.\n\n### OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n\n- **High-Performing Configurations**: The \"overlooked_trials\" data shows that the top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) have values significantly higher than the mean. These should be re-evaluated to understand why they performed so well and whether their configurations can be replicated or improved upon.\n\n### PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- **min_cash_reserve**: Focus on values close to the mean (0.077366) with a slight margin for improvement.\n- **norm_tech_exp**: Aim for values around -15.225191, considering a small range above or below this value.\n\n### INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n\n- **min_cash_reserve and gamma**: Combining higher `min_cash_reserve` (around 0.077366) with low `gamma` values (-0.89 to -0.99) could be promising.\n- **norm_tech_exp and gamma**: Exploring configurations where `norm_tech_exp` is around -15.225191 and `gamma` is also low (around 0.89 to -0.99) might yield better results.\n\n### ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n\n1. **Re-examine Top Performers**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) to identify specific configurations that led to their success. This could involve comparing these trials with other high-value trials and understanding what factors contributed to their performance.\n\n2. **Fine-Tune Parameter Ranges**: Based on the sweet spots identified (`min_cash_reserve` around 0.077366 and `norm_tech_exp` around -15.225191), fine-tune the parameter ranges in future trials to explore values slightly above or below these means.\n\n3. **Explore Parameter Combinations**: Specifically, test configurations that combine high `min_cash_reserve` with low `gamma` values, as well as configurations where both `norm_tech_exp` and `gamma` are optimized. This could involve running additional trials with these specific combinations to see if they lead to even better performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, future training runs can be more data-driven and potentially yield higher performance outcomes."
