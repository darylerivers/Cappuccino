1. **KEY INSIGHTS**:
   - The top performers have a higher average `base_break_step` compared to the bottom performers, which suggests that the agent is more likely to break through its target steps successfully.
   - There is a slight difference in the number of threads (`thread_num`) between the top and bottom performers. However, this difference is relatively small.
   - The `worker_num` parameter shows a slightly different average for the top versus bottom performers, with the top performing trials having one more worker. This could indicate that the additional worker provides a marginal benefit.
   - The `norm_cash_exp`, `norm_reward_exp`, and `lookback` parameters show minor differences between top and bottom performers, but they are not significant enough to be considered impactful.

2. **POTENTIAL ISSUES**:
   - The high standard deviation in the results suggests that there is a lot of variability in the agent's performance. This could be due to factors such as environmental noise or random initialization of the agent.
   - The mean and median values are relatively close, indicating a lack of clear separation between top and bottom performers based on these hyperparameters alone.

3. **RECOMMENDATIONS**:
   - **Increase `base_break_step`**: Since higher `base_break_step` values seem to correlate with better performance, consider increasing this parameter to encourage more successful breaks through target steps.
     ```python
     base_break_step: [125000, 130000]
     ```
   - **Adjust `worker_num`**: Given that the difference is marginal but still exists, experimenting with a few more workers could help identify an optimal number for your specific use case.
     ```python
     worker_num: [11, 14]
     ```
   - **Fine-tune `norm_cash_exp` and `norm_reward_exp`**: Although these differences are small, adjusting them might slightly improve the agent's performance by fine-tuning its risk/reward balancing.
     ```python
     norm_cash_exp: [-12.0, -11.5]
     norm_reward_exp: [-13.5, -11.5]
     ```
   - **Consider additional exploration**: Introduce a small amount of noise or exploration to the agent's actions to explore more diverse strategies and improve its decision-making.

4. **SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT**:
   - **Expand `base_break_step` range**: Since higher values seem beneficial, expanding this range could help identify an optimal value.
     ```python
     base_break_step: [120000, 135000]
     ```
   - **Narrow `worker_num` range**: Given the slight difference identified, narrowing down to more closely balanced values might provide a clearer insight into the optimal number of workers.
     ```python
     worker_num: [11, 14]
     ```
   - **Tighten `norm_cash_exp` and `norm_reward_exp` ranges**: To ensure precision in tuning these parameters, consider narrowing down the ranges.
     ```python
     norm_cash_exp: [-12.0, -11.5]
     norm_reward_exp: [-13.5, -11.5]
     ```

5. **ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS**:
   - **Try a different algorithm**: Since PPO seems to be performing reasonably well but with significant variability, consider trying an alternative algorithm like SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) or TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient). These algorithms might offer better stability and performance in certain environments.
     ```python
     # Example for SAC
     algorithm: SAC
     ```
   - **Improve environment simulation**: Ensure that the environment simulation is as realistic and noise-free as possible. This can sometimes have a significant impact on agent performance.

By focusing on these recommendations, you can further refine your hyperparameters and potentially improve the overall performance of your cryptocurrency trading DRL agent.
