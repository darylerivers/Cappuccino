  "ai_insights": "1. **KEY FINDINGS**:\n   - The most significant correlation is between `gamma` and `norm_action`, with a correlation coefficient of 0.3208, indicating that higher gamma values tend to lead to higher normalized action values.\n   - A negative correlation exists between `gamma` and `min_cash_reserve` (-0.3505), suggesting that higher gamma values may require more cash reserves for optimal performance.\n   - The parameter `norm_tech_exp` has a strong negative correlation with both `gamma` (-0.381) and `norm_action` (-0.352), indicating that it should be adjusted carefully when tuning these parameters.\n\n2. **OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES**:\n   - The \"overlooked_trials\" data shows high-performing configurations, specifically trials 191 to 195 with values ranging from 0.156558 to 0.133606. These configurations should be reconsidered as they demonstrate superior performance compared to the average and best values in the dataset.\n\n3. **PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS**:\n   - Based on the parameter sweet spots, `gamma` should ideally be set between 0.98 and 0.99 for optimal performance.\n   - For `min_cash_reserve`, a value around 0.12 to 0.15 would be ideal, as it balances the need for cash reserves with the potential for high gamma values.\n   - The range for `norm_action` should be between 23,000 and 25,000, which is slightly higher than the mean but within a reasonable margin.\n\n4. **INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE**:\n   - The interaction between `gamma`, `min_cash_reserve`, and `norm_tech_exp` shows complex dependencies that should be explored further. Specifically, adjusting these parameters together could lead to better performance.\n\n5. **ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS**:\n   - **Focus on High-Performing Configurations**: Re-evaluate configurations 191 to 195 to understand their unique characteristics and incorporate lessons learned into future training.\n   - **Tune `gamma` and `min_cash_reserve` Together**: Since they have a strong negative correlation, consider tuning these parameters simultaneously to optimize the model's performance.\n   - **Reduce Variance in `norm_tech_exp`**: Given its high negative correlations with other parameters, explore strategies to reduce variance or adjust this parameter more carefully during training."
