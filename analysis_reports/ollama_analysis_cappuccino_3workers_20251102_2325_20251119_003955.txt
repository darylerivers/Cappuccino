### KEY INSIGHTS:
1. **Base Break Step**: The top performers have a significantly higher `base_break_step` value compared to the bottom performers. This suggests that agents with larger break steps might achieve better performance because they can handle longer term rewards more effectively.

2. **Norm Action and Norm Reward/Cash Exponent**: These parameters control normalization, which affects how the agent interprets reward signals. The top performers have smaller `norm_action` values and smaller negative `norm_reward_exp` and `norm_cash_exp` values. This indicates that they might be better at interpreting continuous actions and rewards, potentially leading to more stable and higher-performing agents.

3. **Thread and Worker Numbers**: The top performers tend to use a slightly larger number of threads (`thread_num`) and workers (`worker_num`). More resources can allow for better exploration of the action space and could lead to improved performance.

4. **Batch Size**: The top performers have smaller `batch_size` values, which might suggest that they are more sensitive to small updates and can handle local gradients more effectively.

### POTENTIAL ISSUES:
1. **NaN Values in Best Performance Trial**: The best performing trial contains NaN values. This indicates a potential issue with the agent's behavior or environment interaction, possibly due to an error or an invalid state-action pair.

2. **High Std Dev**: The standard deviation of the performance is relatively high (0.033666), indicating variability in performance across trials. While this can be expected in reinforcement learning, it suggests that there might be room for improvement in stability and consistency.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Increase `base_break_step`**: Try increasing the `base_break_step` by a small margin (e.g., from 72000 to 75000) to see if agents can better handle longer term rewards.

2. **Fine-tune Normalization Parameters**: Experiment with smaller values for `norm_action`, and slightly increase the negative values of `norm_reward_exp` and `norm_cash_exp` (e.g., from -8.7 to -8.5 and -12.8 to -12.6) to see if this improves the agent's ability to interpret rewards and actions.

3. **Adjust Thread and Worker Numbers**: Increase the number of threads (`thread_num`) slightly, say to 15 or 16, and also increase the number of workers (`worker_num`) to 15 or 16. This could help the agents explore the action space more thoroughly.

4. **Reduce Batch Size**: Try reducing the batch size (e.g., from 0.1 to 0.05) to see if this makes the agent more responsive to local gradients and helps in achieving better stability.

### SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT:
- **Expand `base_break_step` Range**: Consider expanding the range of `base_break_step` from, say, 70000 to 80000.
- **Tighten Normalization Parameters**: Narrow the ranges for `norm_action`, `norm_reward_exp`, and `norm_cash_exp` to more closely match those of top performers.
- **Adjust Worker Range**: Expanding the worker range from 14-15 might be beneficial.

### ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS:
1. **Try Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: PPO is an on-policy algorithm that often performs well in financial trading environments due to its stability and ability to handle continuous actions effectively.
2. **Experiment with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)**: A3C can be effective in parallelizing the training process, which might help improve efficiency and performance, especially with multiple workers.
3. **Consider Using a TD(0) Target Network**: In DDPG or SAC, using a TD(0) target network can sometimes stabilize learning and improve performance.

### CONCRETE SUGGESTION:
- **Next Steps**: Focus on tuning the `base_break_step`, normalization parameters (`norm_action`, `norm_reward_exp`, `norm_cash_exp`), and worker numbers while experimenting with PPO as the next algorithm. Monitor the performance closely to see if these changes lead to consistent improvement.

By implementing these recommendations, you should be able to refine your hyperparameters and potentially achieve better performance in your cryptocurrency trading DRL agent.
