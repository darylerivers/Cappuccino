  "ai_insights": "### KEY FINDINGS:\n1. **High Correlations**: Several parameters show high correlations with the trial value, indicating that they significantly impact performance. These include `norm_tech_exp`, `gamma`, `min_cash_reserve`, `norm_action`, and `volatility_penalty`.\n2. **Negative Correlations**: Parameters like `lookback`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, and `time_decay_floor` have negative correlations with the trial value, suggesting that increasing these parameters might lead to better performance.\n3. **Parameter Sweet Spots**: The mean values for certain parameters (e.g., `min_cash_reserve`, `norm_tech_exp`) are close to their minimum or maximum limits, indicating that pushing these parameters towards their extremes could yield better results.\n\n### OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n1. **High-Performing Configurations**: Trials 191, 192, and 26 have values significantly higher than the mean (0.156558, 0.156517, 0.156289). These should be re-examined to understand why they performed so well.\n2. **Trial Number 195**: This trial has a value of 0.133606 and is ranked 10th overall. It shows promise despite being lower than the mean, indicating that there might be room for improvement in this configuration.\n\n### PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. **Min Cash Reserve**: Focus on values close to its maximum (0.25) or slightly below.\n2. **Norm Tech Exp**: Aim for values between -18.0 and -15.0, as indicated by the sweet spot mean of -15.2337.\n3. **Gamma**: Set gamma between 0.98 and 0.99 to leverage its positive correlation with performance.\n4. **Volatility Penalty**: Keep this parameter within a range of 0.0 to 0.04, as it has a negative correlation.\n\n### INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n1. **Min Cash Reserve & Norm Tech Exp**: These parameters have a moderate positive correlation (0.3243), suggesting that optimizing both together could yield better results.\n2. **Norm Tech Exp & Gamma**: The strong negative correlation (-0.4049) indicates that these parameters should be adjusted in opposite directions to improve performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n1. **Increase Min Cash Reserve**: Experiment with values closer to 0.25 to see if it improves performance.\n2. **Adjust Norm Tech Exp**: Try setting `norm_tech_exp` between -18.0 and -15.0 to leverage its positive correlation with performance.\n3. **Fine-Tune Gamma**: Set gamma slightly below 0.99 (e.g., 0.98) to maximize its impact on performance.\n\nBy focusing on these parameter ranges and interactions, future training runs can be more likely to achieve higher performance, as evidenced by the high-performing configurations identified in the analysis."
