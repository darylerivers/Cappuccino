1. **KEY INSIGHTS**:
   - The `base_break_step` and `norm_action` parameters show significant differences between the top and bottom performers, indicating they are highly impactful.
   - The `net_dimension`, `base_target_step`, `eval_time_gap`, `norm_cash_exp`, `norm_reward_exp`, and `thread_num` also have noticeable differences, suggesting that these parameters are also important.
   - There is a slight difference in the number of PPO epochs between top and bottom performers. However, this is not as pronounced as the other parameters.

2. **POTENTIAL ISSUES**:
   - The presence of NaN values in the best and worst trial performance suggests that there might be issues with initialization or gradient calculations, which could lead to instability.
   - A wide standard deviation indicates that the model's performance is quite sensitive to hyperparameter settings.

3. **RECOMMENDATIONS**:
   - **`base_break_step`:** Since this parameter significantly impacts performance, it would be beneficial to explore a range around its top performer value of 123000.
   - **`norm_action`:** Similarly, increase the exploration in this range from 17900 to a higher value.
   - **`net_dimension`:** Consider decreasing this dimension closer to the bottom performers' average (around 1542).
   - **`base_target_step`:** Keep the value close to the top performer's average of 806, and explore slight variations around it.
   - **`eval_time_gap`:** Narrow down the evaluation time gap to a range between 30 and 90 seconds based on the top performer's value.

4. **SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT**:
   - Narrow `base_break_step` to a tighter range around 123000.
   - Increase `norm_action` exploration from 17900 to something like 30000.
   - Decrease `net_dimension` closer to the bottom performers' average (around 1542).
   - Keep `base_target_step` close to 806, but explore slightly above and below this value.
   - Narrow down `eval_time_gap` to a range between 30 and 90 seconds.

5. **ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS**:
   - **Try A2C:** Since PPO often performs well but can be sensitive to hyperparameters, consider exploring the Alternating Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, which might offer a more straightforward approach.
   - **Adjust Learning Rate Decay:** Implement learning rate decay for the policy and value functions. This can help in stabilizing training by gradually reducing the step size during optimization.
   - **Evaluate Regularization Techniques:** Consider incorporating regularization techniques like L2 regularization or dropout to prevent overfitting.

By focusing on these hyperparameter adjustments, you can potentially improve the stability and performance of your DRL agent. Additionally, exploring different algorithms might offer new insights and potential improvements.
