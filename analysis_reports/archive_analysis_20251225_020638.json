  "ai_insights": "### KEY FINDINGS:\n1. **High Correlation Between Parameters**: Several parameters are strongly correlated with each other, indicating that changes in one parameter can have a significant impact on others.\n2. **Positive Impact of `gamma` and `norm_action`**: Both `gamma` (discount factor) and `norm_action` (normalized action space) show positive correlations with the trial value, suggesting they positively influence performance.\n3. **Negative Impact of `volatility_penalty`, `min_cash_reserve`, and `value_loss_coef`**: These parameters have negative correlations with the trial value, indicating that higher values in these parameters lead to lower performance.\n\n### OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n1. **High-Performing Configurations**: The top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) should be reconsidered as they have significantly higher values than the mean and median of the dataset.\n2. **Revisiting Overlooked Trials**: The overlooked trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) with high values (0.156558, 0.156517, etc.) should be given more attention as they indicate potential improvements in the model's performance.\n\n### PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. **`gamma`: Range from 0.98 to 0.99**\n   - This range is based on the mean value (0.9807) and a reasonable margin of error, considering the standard deviation (0.0119).\n2. **`norm_action`: Range from 23,000 to 25,000**\n   - This range is based on the mean value (23,156.53) and a reasonable margin of error, considering the standard deviation (3,096.08).\n3. **`volatility_penalty`: Range from 0 to 0.05**\n   - This range is based on the mean value (0.0054) and a reasonable margin of error, considering the standard deviation (0.0092).\n\n### INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n1. **`gamma` and `norm_action`: Correlation = 0.3394**\n   - These parameters seem to work well together, so exploring different combinations within their recommended ranges could be beneficial.\n2. **`gamma` and `volatility_penalty`: Correlation = -0.3139**\n   - Reducing the volatility penalty while keeping a high gamma might lead to improved performance.\n3. **`norm_action` and `volatility_penalty`: Correlation = -0.1733**\n   - Adjusting these parameters together could help in finding an optimal balance for performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n1. **Increase Exploration of High-Performing Configurations**: Focus on the top-performing trials (trial numbers 191, 192, etc.) and explore their configurations further to understand why they perform so well.\n2. **Fine-Tune `gamma` and `norm_action`**: Experiment with different combinations within their recommended ranges to see if there are even higher performing configurations.\n3. **Adjust `volatility_penalty` and `min_cash_reserve`:** Since these parameters have negative correlations, try reducing the volatility penalty while keeping a high gamma to potentially improve performance.\n\nBy following these recommendations, future training runs can be more focused on optimizing key parameters and exploring promising combinations, leading to better overall performance in cryptocurrency trading."
