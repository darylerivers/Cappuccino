  "ai_insights": "### KEY FINDINGS:\n\n1. **High Correlations with Negative Impact**: Several parameters have high negative correlations with the trial value, indicating that increasing their values could negatively impact performance. These include `min_cash_reserve`, `norm_cash_exp`, and `norm_action`.\n\n2. **Positive Correlation with GAE Lambda**: The parameter `gae_lambda` has a positive correlation with the trial value, suggesting that higher values of this parameter might lead to better performance.\n\n3. **Sweet Spot Identification**: Certain parameters have identified sweet spots, which are optimal ranges for their best performance. For instance, `min_cash_reserve` should be within 0.129787 \u00b1 0.049629 (i.e., between approximately 0.079958 and 0.179616).\n\n### OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITIES:\n\nThe \"overlooked_trials\" data highlights high-performing configurations that might have been overlooked due to their lower ranks. Specifically, trial number 1 with a value of 0.052278 should be reconsidered as it has the highest overall rank (1). Trial number 0 also stands out with a relatively higher value of 0.034993.\n\n### PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nBased on the correlations and sweet spots, future training should focus on the following parameter ranges:\n- **GAE Lambda**: Optimal values are around 0.9281 (mean) \u00b1 0.0204 (std), i.e., between approximately 0.9077 and 0.9485.\n- **Min Cash Reserve**: Focus on values within the sweet spot, i.e., between approximately 0.079958 and 0.179616.\n- **Norm Cash Exp**: Aim for values closer to the mean of -14.1702, with a tolerance of \u00b1 2.3985 (i.e., between approximately -16.5687 and -11.7717).\n- **Max Grad Norm**: Optimal values are around 1.0149 (mean) \u00b1 0.3426 (std), i.e., between approximately 0.6723 and 1.3575.\n\n### INTERACTIONS TO EXPLORE:\n\nBased on the interaction data, the following parameter combinations seem promising:\n- **GAE Lambda vs Norm Cash Exp**: Both parameters have negative correlations with trial value, suggesting that optimizing both together could lead to better performance.\n- **GAE Lambda vs Norm Action**: Although there is a positive correlation between these two parameters, it's worth exploring how they interact within different ranges of values.\n\n### ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS:\n\n1. **Revisit High-Performing Trials**: Given the high value and low rank of trial number 1 (0.052278), it would be beneficial to revisit this configuration and understand why it performed so well. This could provide insights into potential improvements or overlooked aspects.\n\n2. **Adjust Parameter Ranges**: Based on the identified sweet spots, narrow down the parameter ranges for `min_cash_reserve`, `norm_cash_exp`, and `max_grad_norm` during future training runs. This will help in finding configurations that are more likely to perform well based on historical data.\n\n3. **Explore Interactions**: Conduct additional experiments focusing on the interactions between `gae_lambda`, `norm_cash_exp`, and `norm_action`. By understanding how these parameters interact, you can develop more effective strategies for tuning them together, potentially leading to higher performance outcomes."
