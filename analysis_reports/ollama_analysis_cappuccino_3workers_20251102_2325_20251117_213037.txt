1. **KEY INSIGHTS**:
   - The top performers have a consistent higher average value compared to the bottom performers, indicating that these hyperparameters might contribute significantly to better trading strategies.
   - `norm_action` seems to be the most impactful parameter since it has a significant difference between the top and bottom performers, despite having a low standard deviation. This suggests that normalization of actions plays a crucial role in effective trading.
   - The `base_break_step`, `net_dimension`, `base_target_step`, and `eval_time_gap` also show substantial differences, indicating that these parameters might influence trading decision-making processes.
   - Parameters like `norm_reward_exp` and `thread_num` have slightly smaller differences but still indicate some variability that could be optimized further.

2. **POTENTIAL ISSUES**:
   - There are 9 failed trials out of 4446, which might suggest issues with the environment setup or initializations.
   - The presence of NaN values in the best and top 5 performing trials indicates potential problems during training that need to be addressed.

3. **RECOMMENDATIONS**:
   - **Increase `norm_action`**: Since it has a significant difference between top and bottom performers, exploring different ranges for this parameter could improve performance.
   - **Optimize `base_break_step` and `net_dimension`**: These parameters also show substantial differences, suggesting they significantly impact the agent’s trading decisions. Experimenting with narrower or broader ranges might yield better results.
   - **Adjust `thread_num`**: Although its difference is smaller, increasing this parameter could help in parallelizing tasks more effectively.

4. **SEARCH SPACE REFINEMENT**:
   - Narrow `norm_action` range: Consider values around 25000 with a slight variation to see if performance improves.
   - Explore a broader range for `base_break_step`: Try values between 80000 and 90000 to capture different trading behaviors.
   - Adjust the range for `net_dimension` slightly: Try values around 1350-1450 to fine-tune neural network architecture.

5. **ALGORITHMIC SUGGESTIONS**:
   - **Try PPO with a different discount factor (`gamma`)**: Sometimes, adjusting the discount factor can significantly impact policy gradient methods.
   - **Experiment with a more complex reward function**: A custom reward function that better reflects market conditions could lead to improved performance.
   - **Consider using a different exploration strategy**: If the agent is under-exploring or over-exploring, switching to a different exploration technique (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for DDPG) might help.

### Next Steps:
- Conduct a grid search or random search within these refined ranges.
- Monitor convergence and ensure that NaN values do not reappear in the next set of trials.
- Keep an eye on training stability and performance to avoid failures.
