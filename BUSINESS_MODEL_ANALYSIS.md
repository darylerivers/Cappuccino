## My Recommendation

### If You Want to Build a Business:

**Start Here** (Months 0-12):
1. Scale your own trading to $10K-$50K
2. Build a public track record (post all trades on Twitter/blog)
3. Build an audience (tweet daily about algo trading, DRL, results)
4. Create free content (YouTube videos showing your system)

**Then** (Months 12-24):
1. Launch signal service ($50/month)
2. Create a course ($500-$1000)
3. Keep trading your own capital
4. Grow to $100K/year income

**Finally** (Months 24+):
1. Decide if you want to scale big (RIA) or stay boutique
2. Either raise capital or keep focusing on signals/education
3. Hire help for marketing/support

### Realistic Business Income:

**Year 1**: -$5K to $0 (building)
**Year 2**: $20K-$50K (signals + course)
**Year 3**: $75K-$150K (scale)
**Year 4+**: $150K-$500K+ (established)

### Is It Worth It?

**Financially?** Maybe. Takes 2-3 years to replace a dev job income.

### Turning this into a business:
