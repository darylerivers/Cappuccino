URGENT: Speed up training from 11 days to 2-3 days

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Training takes 14.7 min/trial × 1000 trials = 10.2 days
- GPU: AMD RX 7900 GRE (16GB VRAM), 100% utilized, using ~6GB/trial
- Best Sharpe so far: 0.1720 (trial #14 after 12 trials)
- File: scripts/training/1_optimize_unified.py
- Database: databases/optuna_cappuccino.db
- Study: cappuccino_ft_16gb_optimized

PROBLEM: By the time training completes, model is outdated by 7+ days of crypto market data.

YOUR TASK: Modify scripts/training/1_optimize_unified.py to train 3-4x faster.

KEY OPTIMIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT:

1. ADD PRUNING (2-3x speedup)
   - Use optuna.pruners.MedianPruner or HyperbandPruner
   - Kill bad trials after ~30% of training
   - Need to add trial.report() calls in training loop

2. PARALLEL TRIALS (1.5-2x speedup)
   - study.optimize(..., n_jobs=2)
   - GPU has 16GB, using 6GB/trial, so 2 parallel trials should fit
   - Verify no GPU OOM

3. REDUCE TRIALS (2x speedup)
   - Change from 1000 to 400-500 trials
   - Use better sampler (TPESampler with multivariate=True)
   - Use --use-best-ranges mode

PROVIDE:
1. Updated optuna.create_study() code with pruner
2. Updated study.optimize() code with n_jobs
3. Code to add trial.report() in training loop
4. Estimated new training time
5. Any risks/tradeoffs

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must keep model quality (Sharpe >= 0.15)
- Must use FT-Transformer (--force-ft)
- Must fit in 16GB GPU VRAM
- Production-ready code only

GOAL: 2-3 days training time, maintain Sharpe ~0.17+
